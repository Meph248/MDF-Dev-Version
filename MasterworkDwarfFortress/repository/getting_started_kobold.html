        <p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Getting a good embark spot is more important for kobolds than for other races. A cave will allow quick access to the underground, and deep soil layers are especially valuable to get more room to live. A forested area will help, giving you access to much needed wood for your tents. Since kobolds dont eat plants, farming isnt that important and very cold or hot biomes are perfectly fine. </p>
        <p>I would recommend embarking with plenty of lifestock, jack rats most of all. Without leather you cant build tents, and kobolds need to eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>After the embark:</strong> Once you embarked you can build a large tent, and set up a dirt digger inside. He can supply you with shovels to dig. Important in the beginning is to prepare some kind of defense, be it a moat, wall or traps. Kobolds cant fight well and you will surely fall if you dont hide the first few fights.</p>
<p>Hunting and farming animals will give you the access to most materials you need. Kobolds very much rely on organic materials, like leather meat and bone for their buildings, weapons and armors. Poisoned ranged weapons and ogre pets should be a good defense. Little huts with basements is the design I usually choose for my camps, with the workshops on the surface and the living are 1-2 z levels below, in the soil.</p>
<p>A breeding warren helps female kobolds to give offspring, which comes of age in only 1 year. This will help you populate your fort quickly. </p>
<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> Stealing building designs from other races is the name of the game. You can only unlock high-end buildings by building a thieves tunnel and sending kobolds on missions. It only has a 5% chance of giving you the tech, and might trigger an attack long before that. So make sure to be ready before trying this. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>General info:</strong> Kobolds are numerous, tantrum resistant, weak and stupid. Your camp will be on the surface and in the soil layers, protected mostly by wartrained pets and ranged-bolds. Farming animals for leather, bone and meat is most important, farming plants for dye, juice, tea and tobacco not so much. Main income source of better items is stealing, which is risky but the only way to advance further.</p>
<p align="center">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Kobolds have natural skills in herbalism, blowgun, dodging, poisoning and sneaking. The most important skills in camp life is leatherworking.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Kobolds are tiny and weak, and should rely on ranged weapons and traps. Melee combat is mostly done by your pet-ogres.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> Most weapons are too big for kobolds, so you have make your own, weak ones. Slings, Blowguns and Bola-Throwers are the weapons of choice.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> You have cheap poisoned ammo at the start, use it. Slowpoke blowdarts.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Kobold armor is slightly inferior to those of other races. Shin/Thight/Wrist-Guards, Plated Hides and Caps.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> The main building material is leather, you need wood for fuel, different sorts of leather for armor. Fire-safe blocks should be made from bone. Clay is unlimited, but needs fuel.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Kobolds use shalswars to hunt vermin, trap spiders for silk-farms, ogres to fight, fisher-gremlins to fish, badgers and keas as sacred animals that can be interacted with, and psychoactive toads that give truly random effects. Jack rats are the main food source, giving birth to 3-5 babies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Kobolds need meat. They wont eat plants, so farm-plots are only for extra-ingredients, main food source is animal farming, fishing and hunting.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Alcohol makes kobolds dizzy. Press juices or brew tea instead.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Kobolds can only dig with breakable shovels, which only last about a week.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> You should take many, many jack-rats with you, for meat, leather and bones. Embark on a cave to have access to the caverns, which is really important for you. Fisher-Gremlins can take some workload at the start and supply you with fishes.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> The nobles are exactly the same as in dwarf mode, just with different names.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>You have 2 mages, ranged and melee, but both take a while to create. Dont worry about it now.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> You high-tech workshops are stolen from other civs. You will lose kobolds this way. You will also trigger sieges this way. But its the only way to get these building plans.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Kobolds come in twelve types. Simple changes, so dont worry about it. Viper, Badger and Lizard are good for combat though.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Cave-Embarks, plants for dyes, poisons, leather, leather, leather, Ogres.</p>
