        <p>Humans do not get many unique items, as they are a race that gains most of their tech from trading with other races. You have the normal melee and ranged weapons, ammo, armors and clothing, like any other race. There are only minor changes.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Weapons:</strong></p>
        <p>Bows and arrows are you basic ranged weapon. </p>
        <p>Pistols are the one-handed ranged weapon of choice for humans. Better than crossbows, with more ammo to carry. They do require a chemist and a gunsmith, or can be bought from merchants.</p>
        <p>Muskets are the two-handed version of pistols. More powerful, but do not allow a shield to be used at the same time.</p>
        <p>Hand-Cannons are the highest tier of ranged weapons. Again more powerful, but their ammo is very expensive to procude.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Shields:</strong></p>
        <p>Torches: can be assigned to soldiers to negate any cave-adaption effect, which allows you to safely send them underground. Filling the shield slot, they make the melee squad easier targets for subterranean monsters, so take care.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
        <p>Contracts are tools made by the forge or craftsman. You need them to rent an empty workshop to a foreign trader. You can only make human workshops, renting out buildings to a human gunsmith from the capital. To get contracts from other races, you have to call their caravan and order them. Each contract gives you access to their traders, workshop, stage or university for 3 months.</p>
