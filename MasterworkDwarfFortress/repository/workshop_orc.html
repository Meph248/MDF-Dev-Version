      <td width="798"><h1>Core Workshops</h1>
        <p>Orcs can use most all of the workshops from vanilla Dwarf Fortress.  For the
          most part we won't go into too much detail as, there's not too much to say
          about these 'shops: like most races, they cook and brew, hew blocks from stone,
          and process cloth from plants. Orcs can use some of the workshops introduced in
          Masterwork, including the Boneyard, Storage Unit, Fishpond, Slag Pit, and
          Apothecary. The Boneyard and Storage Unit, in particular, are key fixtures in
          an Orcish fort for processing the enemy and their belongings.A few Masterwork
          shops, the Orcs can use in a limited capacity.  For example, Orcs can make
          common alloys at the metallurgist, but they cannot  produce patternwelded
          mithril bars or other fine dwarven alloys there. Orcs can use the Trap
          Engineer, but not the advanced &quot;2nd level&quot; of upgrades. </p>
        <p>Recently founded Orc clan holdings can't establish the Stonecutter, Rockforge,
          Tailor, Poisoner, Gunsmith, or Sawmill, but see the entry on <em>The Goblin
            Ghetto</em> to see how these industries are supported in larger Orcish villages. </p>
        <p>Orcs lack access to uniquely Dwarven buildings like the Gemforge and
          Glassforge, the Library system, Timberyard, advanced Forge and Furnaces, the
          Armory and Weaponry, Runesmith, and Armok Religion buildings. </p>
        <h2>Basic Industry</h2>
        <h3>Orcish Tribal Craft Wargear</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/tribal_wargear.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>This can be a very important workshop for an early settlement, especially if
          elves or other dangerous ambushers are settled nearby and you need to get a
          strong military online fast.  It lets Leather and Bone-workers create archaic
          but deadly weapons and decent armor without any anvil or metal.  The inputs are
          mostly organic materials that can be supplied by hunters (or warriors...) like
          leather, shells, wood, ash, and bone.  The craftsman can even infuse the
          weapons with blood in a dark ritual to make steel-quality weapons.   Therefore,
          the Tribal Craftsorc should be grouped with the butchery, tannery, boneyard,
          and crematory/ashery for best results.  Forts with a strong metal industry may
          eventually phase out much of the work due to the complex recipes and limited
          selection, but some tribal crafters continue to earn their keep by making
          masks, cloaks, or decorative armor for export.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Lamellar leather:</em> There are several options for ways to make lamellar leather by combining simple exotic leather with horn, wood, or shell.</li>
          <li><em>Armor</em>:  The crafter can make armor sets, robes, cloaks, and masks from lamellar leather; this is about as good a protection as one can get from leather.</li>
          <li><em>Handcrafted Weapons</em>:  The basic &quot;ironbone&quot; quality weapons are made from lamellar, ash, bone, and fuel.  Upgraded &quot;bloodsteel&quot; claws also require a barrel of blood but will punch through most armor.  Alternative recipe uses obsidian.</li>
          <li><em>Armor decoration</em>:  Use gems, shell, and wood to apply batches of decoration to armor and helms.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Boneforge</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/boneforge.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The boneforge is where orcs can use ancient techniques to form
          ironbone and bloodsteel. Ironebone is formed from one stack of bones
          and two bars of ash. It can be transmuted into the stronger bloodsteel
          with a barrel of blood and an additional bar of ash.</p>
        <p>Logs can be reduced to ash at the boneforge, and blood extracted from
          meat into barrels. Be warned that an entire stack of meat is required
          for a barrel of blood.</p>
        <h3>Orcish Fletcher</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/fletcher.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Many Orc clans rely heavily on archers to hunt, and to provide ranged support
          for the warbands.  The Fletcher makes composite bows, requiring lamellar
          leather as well as wood, or bone or iron.  These bows are twice as powerful as
          the orcish recurve bow, that is, four times the primitive standard bow, so it
          is worth upgrading when possible. The fletcher can also make batches of arrows
          from lots of common materials, freeing up your forges for other work.</p>
        <h3>Orcish Factory</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/factory.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The Factory is a multi-purpose building found in most permanent Orcish
          settlements.  It can be used to make big batches of building material, perfect
          for big building projects above ground.  It turns farmed trees directly into
          charcoal while also collecting seeds -- note, Orcs don't use a Timberyard.
          There are a few good options for batches of weapons, quite efficient use of
          bars assuming you are using &quot;Harder Smithing&quot; setting, but not a great amount
          of selection.</p>
        <p>The Factory also allows mass production of cheap gear from inferior metals,
          perfect for front line grunts or for weapon traps. Mass produced goods are
          sufficient for Orcish Raid parties, too.</p>
        <h3>Oricsh Molten Pit</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/molten_pit.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/magma_pit.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The Molten Pit is a versatile building with a couple different uses. First, it
          is the Orcish mass production furnace.  The efficiency is a bit low, and some
          of the material produced will be low quality rusty iron.  Rusty iron can be
          used at the factory for rebar, barbed wire;  minted into coins to pay
          Freelancers; or it can be cleaned up into regular useable iron at the
          blacksmoke furnace. Orcs are comfortable working with low grade metals, and the
          worker will automatically dispose of any waste slag and sometimes recycle small
          quantities of usable product like flux, potash, or malachite.</p>
        <p>The Molten Pit can also be used to reforge ill-fitting salvaged armor and
          weapons from pitiful small enemies.   Re-forging allows you to very quickly
          convert small gear made from good materials into usable armor. Note, however,
          that the &quot;cheap&quot; recycled or factory pressed armor have some gaps and misfits,
          so they only provide 80% coverage. Be careful to use stockpiles to control
          which pieces the worker recycles, and be aware that if put on &quot;repeat&quot; he may
          wastefully rework the same item over and over.  Simply scrapping the items will
          provide a chance to recycle materials from the slag, but it will always be low
          grade metals.  If you want to melt a piece down to recover high quality
          material bars, you should use the normal smelter.</p>
        <h3>Blacksmoke Furnace</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/blacksmoke_furnace.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The blacksmoke furnace is the is cornerstone of orcish heavy industry. It
          allows the extraction of oil from oilbearing stones, or the conversion of four
          bars of coke into oil. Acid can be distilled from flux, a vial, and a boulder
          of either brimstone, saltpeter, or rock salt. Be warned that acid is so
          corrosive it will render the vial unusuable after the vial of acid has been
          used in a reaction.</p>
        <p>Acid allows for the removal of rust from iron or steel, and oil is used in the
          processing of rare minerals such as aluminum, chromium, cobalt, and titanium.
          Batches of fire and acid arrows can be crafted with wood, iron and oil/acid
          respectively. Foreign-made cannons can be upgraded to flamethrowers, and oil
          and mechanisms can be combined in a box to create detonator or stickbomb
          satchels, which the bravest of warriors can carry instead of a shield.
          Finally, acid and oil can be combined to form synthsilk. While not as valuable
          as the rare silks found in nature, it's perfectly serviceable for use in
          threads and cloth.</p>
        <p>All reactions at the blacksmoke furnace require fuel.</p>
        <h3>Steamfoundry</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/steamfoundry.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The steamfoundry uses the skills of an advanced mechanic to improve existing
          orcish materials and items. If orcs come into the possession of a prototype
          golem, they can activate, equip, and repair it here.  Many reactions requite an
          automaton gizmo, which are looted from automaton corpses. However resourceful
          orcs can enchant these from an existing mechanism and a soul-gem (enchanted at
          a totem pole).</p>
        <p>The steamfoundry allows of the construction of synthshells (equivalent to
          shellplate) by impregnating cloth with aluminium or titanium.  The steamforge
          can upgrade scimitars, toothed axes, mauls, and flachette guns to more powerful
          mechanised versions. These all require oil, automaton gizmos, and razorwire
          (edged weapons), lead (mauls), or brass (flachette guns).</p>
        <p>Finally, if orcs obtain a toolkit or dwarf tools, they can create powerful
          landmines (toolkit) or upgraded axe and saw traps (dwarf tools).  Upgraded
          traps also require pulleys, which can be raided from merchant shipping,
          purchased at the arms bazaar, or crafted at the goblin tinkerer.</p>
        <h3>Damascene Workshop</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/damasc_forge.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/magma_damasc.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>A warlord and his chosen war-orcs might get their weapons at a Orcish Damascene
          Shop, where an artesian uses ancient methods to fold exquisite blades from rare
          metals.  Unfortunately, the orcish damasc worker needs foreign tools salvaged
          from human or dwarven loot to make the finest armors. The Damascene folder
          requires rare ores such as mithril, cobalt, or wolfram; and tempers these
          alloys with steel, copper, silver, or gold.  He uses powdered materials
          directly to create unique alloys, and cannot create standard bars for use at
          the forge.</p>
        <h3>Arcane Forge</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/arcane_forge.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>In a past age, there were great Orcish dark citadels stretching from the
          surface to the deep roots of impenetrable mountains. Among these Deep-Orcs, the
          greatest armies were lead not by brutish warlords, but fell sorcerer-kings and
          powerful druids.  They wielded special Orichalcum alloy weapons that reinforced
          their magical links to the chaotic magic of the spirit realm, or into the
          eldritch power of the forests. Today the great Arcane Forges of the old
          kingdoms have been lost; destroyed or captured by armies of the jealous Drow
          striking from the underdark.</p>
        <p>The warchief who has enough Orichalcum on hand to light a new Arcane Forge will
          be able to equip his Dreamwalkers with enchanted weapons which give the wielder
          access to powerful battle-magicks. If the wielder is willing to give up use of
          a shield, he can also use an off-hand Dreamcatcher, an arcane focus enchanted
          with a second supporting spell. The Arcane forge can also craft runic ammo to
          be cast from magic weapons, although these must be taken to a Place of Power
          (stone circle, etc.) to become enchanted with any special effects.</p>
        <h2>Outlander Allies' Technology</h2>
        <h3>Ashland Glassblower</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/ashland_glassblower.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The ashclan elves live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, with outposts 
          scattered outside the primeval forests and off the major routes of trade. 
          Without reliable access to steeloak or mithril ore, they have developed an 
          alternative crafts tradition of glassblowing. They make expensive &quot;ruby 
          stained&quot; glass from powdered gold, and fine &quot;cobalt stained&quot; glass from 
          cobaltite. With access to moonstone and malachite, or obsidian, they can 
          make weapons-quality metallic glasses that rival the mithril gear of their 
          silvan cousins, including the sharp, lightweight green ashland glass and heavy 
          ebonglass.</p>
        <h3>Underdark Nethermill</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/nethermill.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Deep drow traditionally patrol the caverns of the underdark with wicked curved
          blades and crossbows made from crystalwood, devilthorn warhammers, and curious
          fire-resistant leather armor made from netherwood. Although their motives are
          suspect, traders from the deep realms sometimes appear offering to share these
          technologies with their allies.</p>
        <h3>Rogue Tavern</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/rogue_tavern.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Human bandits are well known for the raucous pirate dens found in 
          their harbor towns. Gamble for coin, with games available for every price 
          point! Lose money in the long run, but maybe you'll get lucky. Or win the other 
          guy's jewels, weapons, ship... or more if you play at the Shadowbroker's somnium 
          table. Orcs can play some human- or dwarven-style instruments for musical 
          effects, or thoroughly use up any type of instrument by playing Orcish jazz for 
          tips.</p>
        <h3>Legion Auxilla Outpost</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/legion_outpost.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Orcish warriors usually favor their slashing weapons, 
          but those who have fought alongside (or against) the forces of the grim Dwarven 
          Legion can attest to the efficient killing power of an army with a mixed 
          arsenal. The auxilla outpost can craft deadly hammers and piercing spears, 
          cast a variety of bolts and javelins, and combine these dwarf-style weapons into 
          versatile mixed-arms kits which are deadly at both melee and ranged combat.</p>
        <h2>Skill Training</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/bloodbowl.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Orcs do not excel at abstract thought, and have not embraced the concept of
          learning skills from books.  However, the orcs' enthusiasm for physical
          contests and sports can take the place of serious training, to a degree.</p>
        <h3>Blood Bowl / Gateball</h3>
        <p>Orcs are passionate about any sport played with a ball on a field.  The few
          recorded instances of peaceful interaction between Orcs and Humans involve
          orcish speakers trading for the rules and equipment for soccer, rugby, lacross,
          handball, gateball, croquet, and countless other games.  Of course, when they
          get home, they pretty much play every sport the same way, and with very little
          regard for the human version of the rules.  At a training pitch, Orcs can train
          throwing, striking, dodging, coordination, or melee combat, and will use up on
          average 1 piece of leather per 10 skill advances.</p>
        <h3>Weight Set</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/weightset.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Orcs enjoy lifting weights, and even more so enjoy setting up stacks of weights
          arbitrarily and striking them with weapons.  At this station orcs can train
          weapon, armor, and shield skills.  They'll wear out about 1 piece of wood,
          leather, or makeshift armor training equipment per 20 skill advances.</p>
        <h3>Philosopher's Garden</h3>
        <p>(not pictured)</p>
        <p>Even the least intellectually curious Orcs can be convinced to partake in
          activities such as: bellowing their thoughts at random to passersby, or
          delivering rambling semi-dramatic soliloqies to the skulls of defeated enemy.
          A savvy clan leader may be able to frame these activities in a way that
          promotes learning.  At the philosophy podium Orcs can train a variety of mental
          skills, and will use up totems, cloth, and paper supplies at a rate of about 1
          piece per 20 skill advances.</p>
        <h3>Anatomical Theatre</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/anatomical.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Orcish shamans typically have plenty of opportunity to practice their medical
          skills on live targets, but in the rare quiet moment, they can practice
          suturing, bonesetting, or wounddressing at the anatomical theatre.  They will
          consume about 1 piece of thread, cloth, or splint per 10 skill advances.  Some
          clan leaders will also send down enemy cadavers and vermin remains for
          disposal, no questions asked, when the butchery and crematorium are overworked.</p>
        <h1>Caravanserai</h1>
        <div class="adjacent_images"> <img src="screenshots/common_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/arms_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/farmers_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/shadowbroker.png" alt="" /></div>
        <p>The Caravanserai are a set of 4 bazaars that buy and sell goods for coin.  The Caravanserai can only be built by a clan that has proved itself in combat, and requires a standard of honor to be built.  These traders can help you profit while decluttering your Fort by buying all sorts of goods
          such as food, cloth, leather, and weapons from your base in exchange for cold,
          hard cash. You can turn around and buy stuff with the coins, or even with coins
          you mint. The bazaars mostly deal in the traditional currency of copper,
          silver, and gold coins; which can be broken into Orcish shillings at the
          Freelancer's Guild. A few high-end transactions are forbidden by the
          international Caravanserai charter, and these must only be conducted in
          platinum currency available at the Shadowbroker.</p>
        <p>The Common Bazaar lets you sell cloth and leather, exchange low value coins to high, and buy anvils and
          crates of metal. You can also invite immigration and caravans to your fortress by paying the Caravaners to spread the word.</p>
        <p>The Farmers Bazaar lets you sell food and booze, buy wicker,
          potash, and gypsum, and buy seed packets. You can buy surface, cave, and boreal
          seeds which are collected by master gardeners for use in certain biomes.
          There's also a &quot;poisoner's packet,&quot; for discerning customers.</p>
        <p>The Arms Bazaar let you sell junk armor, although the price is a low fixed rate
          (so if it's a good material or decorated, you might want to dispose it a
          different way). You can also buy arrows, mechanisms, trap components, and
          import weapons not common to Orc domestic markets like crossbows and
          warhammers.</p>
        <p>The Shadowbroker helps you acquire platinum coins for special
          transactions, acquire certain tools whose sale falls outside the bounds of
          economic treaty law, and facilitates immigration of goblins &amp; kobolds and the
          ransom of captives from hostile civilizations.</p>
        <h1>Freelancers and Raiders</h1>
        <p><img src="screenshots/freelancers.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Freelancers are Orcish adventurers who have left the Tiaga clans and forged
          connections within the seedier elements of society in the world at large.  They
          will buy and sell goods for cash, and unlike other markets, they are happy to
          perform transactions in Orcish currency — rusty iron shillings.  You can get
          shillings from them for bountys (totems and blood), by selling them nautical
          equipment (grog, cloth, and pulleys), or by fencing large gems, gold &amp;
          silver coins. You can also buy weapons and ammo -- either for your own use, or
          to equip raiding parties.  The Freelancers' Guild is the easiest source for
          pistols and firearm ammo.  The &quot;corsairs arms&quot; consists of a pistol and knife
          (which are wielded together), and is a pretty good deal.  Don't forget, you can
          always mint your own coins at the forge for 1 bar per 500, this is one way to
          use up rusty iron in the fort.</p>
        <p>Prices subject to change, please see your local Freelancers' guild rep for current rates.  Terms and conditions may apply.</p>
        <h2>Raiders Drydock</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/raiders_drydock.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Dwarves may be content to lurk meekly in defense of their ivory spires and
          adamant halls, but Orcs prefer to sow vengeance among the home lands of their
          foes.  From the Raiders' Drydock you can equip a longboat with weapons and
          enough coin for a crew of Freelancers to depart on a expedition of your
          choosing.  The crew are likely to perish forgotten and alone in a distant land;
          but there is a chance they may return instead with an assortment of plundered
          metals, powerful weapons, or even rare blueprints &amp; artifacts for the clan
          Artisians and Dreamwalkers to study. Drydocks <em>must</em> be constructed outside,
          and you are encouraged to build them adjacent to a body of water for maximum
          thematic effect.</p>
        <p>A raiding crew needs three items for their journey:  A raiding boat, a bundle
          of weapons, and a number (usually 5000) of rusty iron coins for expenses.  The
          boat is normally a longboat, constructed at the drydock from 10 wood logs and 3
          ballista parts.  Some clan leaders will try to save wood by using xebec ships
          instead, even though these require cloth and pulleys.  The weapons bundle is
          made from any 5 weapons; even daggers or cheap factory produced gear will be
          fine.  There is a 50% chance that the boat and the weapons bundle survive the
          journey.  Coins can be obtained at the Freelancer's Guild or minted at the
          forge, and the Raiders will spend this money no matter what.  If successful,
          the raid will produce a loot crate with can be opened at the drydock.</p>
        <p>The loot you can get is random, and depends very much on the target!  For
          example, elves may yield wood and saplings, elven weapons, enchanted arrows or
          raw mithril.  A raid on dwarves might yield precious metals, weapons, and rare
          weapon-grade alloys.</p>
        <h2>Goblin &amp; Kobold Ghetto</h2>
        <p>Goblin and Kobold workers are normally picked up by your
          Raiders, if you send them on a special trip to a village in the hinterlands.
          These voyages are much higher probability of success than raids into hostile
          territories, but still requires a boat, weapon kit, and some shillings.
          You can also sometimes rescue a gob or kob ship's mate from a Merchant raid, or
          you can always just fork over cash to the Shadowbroker to smuggle workers in.
          Until deployed into their workshop, Goblin workers will be stored along with
          other useful items in your Tools stockpile.</p>
        <h3>Goblin Stonecutter's Shanty</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/goblin_stonecutter.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Stonecutter's Shanty</strong> houses a goblin masonry apprentice and his workshop.
          He takes on tasks which are beneath the notice of Orcish masons, like grinding
          excess stone, sorting the magma-safe rocks from others, crafting rock weapons
          and traps, and cutting blocks
          back apart into stone. He can also make rock bins and barrels, although be
          warned that they can be pretty heavy.</p>
        <h3>Goblin Sawmill Shanty</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/goblin_sawmill.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Sawmill Shanty</strong> houses a goblin woodworker and his shop. The goblin
          woodworker is excellent at stretching limited resources; he can cut 20
          planks
          from 5 logs. He can even make big batches of 10 bins or barrels from 5
          logs, as long as he has access to some metal for fasteners.</p>
        <h3>Goblin Tinkerer Shanty</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/goblin_tinkerer.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Tinkerer's Shanty</strong> houses a goblin who can craft advanced
          flachette guns, pistols, and muskets (although the last, only by using up a
          stolen human toolkit). He can also hand-load rounds for guns, making his
          own black powder from scratch without help of a chemist. Since the
          tinkerer uses so much brass and lead, he has his own small low-temperature
          furnace to help with smelting a few basic ores.</p>
        <h3>Kobold Poisoner's Hut</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kobold_poisoner.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Poisoner's Hut</strong> houses a kobold who creates and applies poison to ammo,
          weapons, and trap components. Besides using a number of poison recipes
          stolen from the Free Peoples, the kobold poisoner has developed a few extra
          poisons from Wetland and Boreal plants: an improved universal Blight poison
          distilled from kobold-bulb and cadaverine, and a Pinkskin Bane poison from
          icicle mint and Taiga bloodberry.</p>
        <h3>Kobold Hunter's Hut</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kobold_tracker.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Hunter's Hut</strong> can equip kobold thieves with a dagger and bag, and send
          them out into the world with a chance to steal some precious metals and gems
          for the clan. He can also forge batches of darts, useful if the Goblin Tinkerer
          is providing the troops with flachette guns.  Flachette guns have a good rate
          of fire and so dart batches can be effective for training up a gun warband if
          metal guns &amp; ammo are in low supply. They also make fine trap components,
          perhaps in combination with poisoned darts.</p>
        <h3>Kobold Textile Hut</h3>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kobold_textile.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Kobold Textile Hut</strong> can batch produce sets of clothing from cloth, wool,
          or silk; and can process grasses to wicker. Wicker bins are valued for
          their light weight in any fort, and other wicker furniture can be in great
          demand in overland camps. He can also practice a few tribal
          weavers' tricks such as weaving rope from rope-reed, and stripping wood-stalks
          down to logs.</p>
        <h2>Labor Cells</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/laborcells.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p><strong>The Labor Cells</strong> are a special case. Sometimes your Raiders will take
          captive a Dwarf, Drow, Elf or Human. Large clanholdings generally pass
          these captives quickly through contacts at the Caravanserai's Shadowbroker
          for a significant ransom. However, camps which are short on simple
          materials such as stone, silk, wood, or basic crafts can choose to deploy these
          guests as laborers, although their work presents a significant drain on food
          resources.</p>
        <h2>Caravanserai</h2>
        <div class="adjacent_images"> <img src="screenshots/common_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/arms_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/farmers_bazaar.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/shadowbroker.png" alt="" /></div>
        <p>The Caravanserai are a set of 4 bazaars that buy and sell goods for coin.  It
          is common to loot caravanserai blueprints when Raiding Merchant Shipping, or
          you can buy additional blueprints from the Shadowbroker bazaar.  These traders
          can help you profit while decluttering your Fort by buying all sorts of goods
          such as food, cloth, leather, and weapons from your base in exchange for cold,
          hard cash. You can turn around and buy stuff with the coins, or even with coins
          you mint. The bazaars mostly deal in the traditional currency of copper,
          silver, and gold coins; which can be broken into Orcish shillings at the
          Freelancer's Guild. A few high-end transactions are forbidden by the
          international Caravanserai charter, and these must only be conducted in
          platinum currency available at the Shadowbroker.  The Common Bazaar lets you
          sell cloth and leather, exchange low value coins to high, and buy anvils and
          crates of metal.  The Farmers Bazaar lets you sell food and booze, buy wicker,
          potash, and gypsum, and buy seed packets. You can buy surface, cave, and boreal
          seeds which are collected by master gardeners for use in certain biomes.
          There's also a &quot;poisoner's packet,&quot; for discerning customers.</p>
        <p>The Arms Bazaar let you sell junk armor, although the price is a low fixed rate
          (so if it's a good material or decorated, you might want to dispose it a
          different way). You can also buy arrows, mechanisms, trap components, and
          import weapons not common to Orc domestic markets like crossbows and
          warhammers.  The Shadowbroker helps you acquire platinum coins for special
          transactions, acquire certain tools whose sale falls outside the bounds of
          economic treaty law, and facilitates immigration of goblins &amp; kobolds and the
          ransom of captives from hostile civilizations.</p>
        <h1>Advanced Workshops</h1>
        <h2>Orcish Meadhall</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/warriors_meadhall.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The greatest Orcish heros gather in such a hall to show off 
          their great amassed wealth and trophies taken from fallen foes, and of course to 
          boast about their personal exploits in battle. In this way Orc warriors 
          share secrets with one another and learn advanced martial techniques. The 
          first step is to form a warrior society, represented by a special reusable tool 
          called a Codex. There are four societies which rely on tribal knowledge 
          and domestic weapons, and you can create these Codexes at any time at the 
          Meadhall. There are also Codexes which can be obtained rarely by Raiders, 
          contain secrets stolen from the enemy, and may require rare or imported weapons.</p>
        <p>An Orc then uses a codex, by combining two existing weapons to 
          create a powerful &quot;weapon&quot; item that represents a dual-wield configuration. 
          Many of these Society weapons cannot be used with shield, like the dual-katanas 
          of the Blademasters' Society. Some can be used still with a shield, like 
          the pistol and scimitar of the Seawolves' Society. Note, that the material 
          used in the Society Weapons Loadout depends on the primary weapon in the kit (or 
          the melee weapon if the primary weapon is ranged). Since the item is 
          assembled by great warriors, not crafted by forgemasters, the quality depends on 
          the primary weapon skill of the creator.</p>
        <p>The Meadhall also contains the facilities to brew warriors' 
          spiced meads, such as the rejuvenating Black Draught and the strength-giving 
          Sharkey's Firewater (never mind the slight loss of fine motor skills!), and to 
          craft special bloodsteel lupine masks that put fighters in the right frame of 
          mind for combat. The Ulfzerker's mask promotes the fighting spirit and 
          suppresses pain; the Opaque mask suppresses fear; and the Elite Clanguard's mask 
          boosts the wearers kinesthetic sense.</p>
        <p>The Meadhall requires that four banners of honour be constructed from the scalps
          of fallen foes. Possessing a meadhall is one of the greatest shows of honour
          a clan can have!</p>
        <h2>Obsidian Spire Library</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/obsidian_library.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>It is a time-honored tradition among Orcish magic users: Spells are learned from 
          Mojos, and Mojos are discovered randomly. Most often, mojos are granted in 
          a flash of inspiration to dreamwalkers who perform spiritual rituals at the 
          Places of Power, or when walking ancient dreamlands. However it is
          whispered that some Drow researchers have mastered the art of crafting specific
          &quot;scrolls&quot; -- their profane foreign word for mojos -- on demand.
          Longstanding practice would demand that you hunt down and purge these heretics,
          raze their Obsidian Spire libraries to their scorched foundations, and cast any
          record of their blasphemous existence into the firey abyss.</p>
        <p>However those who desire power over honour may walk the dreams of such drowen
          scholars, seeking a clue to their construction.</p>
        <h2>Heavy Weapons Armory</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/heavy_weapons_armory.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>The humans are surprisingly tenacious survivors, despite their obvious frailty. 
          First they invented plate armor to deflect our arrows and axes, but we learned to crush 
          them by copying their pole-hammers. Next they invented guns which inflict 
          cruel wounds to our warriors from afar, and overran many of our villages. 
          In their arrogance, they forgot that these guns are small, and simple, and that we 
          can easily enough buy or learn to craft them ourselves. Today, they lay siege to our 
          fortresses with powerful siege weapons, steam-powered engines, and massive portable cannons. They 
          forget that we will soon enough obtain the plans to these ultimate weapons as 
          well, and their cowardly stone citadels will no longer protect them. 
          Also, the human cannonballs aren't even filled with magma, which suggests that 
          they might have ignored some other very obvious upgrades too.</p>
        <p>Perhaps if we can walk their dreams for insights to their technology, we can
          use their own inventiveness agaist them?</p>
        <h2>Runesmith</h2>
        <p>Until today you have never understood the Free-peoples' obsession with writing 
          and rune-letters. &quot;Oh powerful warchief, please take this tribute and 
          refrain from burning our humble library, it is only full of tide-tables and 
          geological data.&quot; Pah. But this: a fine Dwarven steel axe, 
          traced with inlaid letters of finely worked silver. You thought little of 
          it at first, the sort of pointless frippery that a Thieves Guild caravaneer 
          would pay a premium for. Until your warband was ambushed by a werewolf, 
          and one of your guards grabbed this strange axe and cut the beast down in two 
          quick strokes; the silver runes suddenly glowing with a curious internal light. 
          A convert to the mysterious power of the written word, you make up your mind to 
          take a return trip and destroy those tide-tables.</p>
        <p>You have heard the dwarves have the most knowledge of using runes of power,
          perhaps you can walk their dreams to learn more?</p>
        <h2>Treesingers' Pagoda</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/treesingers_pagoda.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Our fathers' fathers stalked the ancestors of the elves in primeval forests, 
          just as a jaguar stalks its prey. But we were too lenient to our foe, and
          the elves took us by surprise in developing the cultivation of ironbark and
          steeloak, and by inventing a process for separating mithril.</p>
        <p>Driven from our ancient hunting grounds and from the primal places of power, we 
          have even been surpassed in skill at bowery and fletching. Of course, we 
          have already recovered enough strength to protect our surviving clan-holdings, 
          and our warchiefs today drive the elven assassins bloodied and humbled 
          back to their Retreats. But in order to truly settle the scales, to 
          finally raze their strongholds and hidden vales to ash, we need to master the 
          same secret arts, twisting the forest to obey our will.</p>
        <h2>Ancient Foundry</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/ancient_foundry.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/magma_ancient_foundry.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Ancestors of Uruks, the steppe-tribes, were nomadic warriors... Masters of mail
          armor, axe, and blade, all crafted from the legendary alloy <em>orichalcum</em>.
          Orichalcum blades are sharper than the finest mithril, and armors proof against
          the strongest impacts. Legends tell that it was the perfect metal for
          rune-swords, because the blade itself would hunger for battle.  Sadly the
          technique of crafting this extraordinary metal was lost when the great
          clan-strongholds were burned in the last age.</p>
        <p>It is said that the Dwarves once knew a mystical formula of bronze, as dense as
          wolfram and harder than steel.  Mechanical gears made of this Deep-bronze would
          seem to correct their own movement as if they know the mind of their creator,
          and the Dwarves of this bygone age made mechanical crossbows that could fire a
          bolt through a keyhole at a thousand paces.  It is whispered that one of the
          most terrible curses enacted by the mad Dwarven blood god, Armok, was to erase
          the secrets of Deep-bronze from the minds of the forgemasters.</p>
        <p>The plans to the ancient foundry have been lost to all living races, however it
          is said that dreamwalkers may still walk the dreams of the ancients and rarely
          stumble upon long-forgotten knowledge.</p>
        <h2>Fluidcaster</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/coalstoked_magma_source.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/magma_source.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>Our outriders have been tracking a number of new dwarven settlements in the
          contested frontier.  As you know, we track these settlements closely since
          dwarves are prone to maddeningly stupid behavior, and failed fortresses might
          as well be free loot.  This settlement we're visiting today is the key one --
          yes, warchief, it is on an aquifer.  Yes, on a carp breeding ground, exactly.
          They might as well start crafting their own gabbro coffins?  Yes, warchief,
          that's what we thought as well.  What's more, they just drilled straight down
          into the aquifer like a addleheaded human child.  Yes, warchief, it is madness.</p>
        <p>There, on the edge of the, do you see this building?  It has wheelbarrels of
          coal going in?  Those are tankers coming out.  Tankers?  It is like a
          mine-cart, but see how it is full of water?  Yes.  Well, yesterday it was full
          of liquid fire.  Many coal loads went in, and many tankers of liquid fire came
          out, and then the dwarves went back into the pit with their picks.  Yes, I'm
          sure.  Yes, two of them came running out with their beards on fire afterwards.
          Yes, warchief, it is madness.</p>
        <p>...You are pretty sure that your scouts are not creative enough to spin this
          tall tale with no basis.  But, is it really possible the dwarves have this
          technology??  If so, is it possible that the little bearded marvels are so
          stupid to deploy it for <em>mining an aquifer</em> in some third-rate provence forty
          league south of the middle of nowhere?</p>
        <p>When a dwarven captive was interrogated about this technology, he said that
          even the dwarves themselves know not how it worked. Perhaps this is a remnant
          of ancient times, and perhaps your dreamwalkers can unlock its secrets in their
          dreams?</p>
        <h2>Dreamwalker's Workshops</h2>
        <p><img src="screenshots/totempole.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>There are five magical workshops:  The first is the totem pole, which is
          dedicated to simple rituals that any orc can perform.  At the totem pole, Orcs
          can fortify their courage or pain resistance. The totem pole is also the
          gathering point for Orcish musicians who use tambourines, didgeridoos, or
          bagpipes to encourage their clansmates to acts of valor.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the totem pole allows for the transmutation of bone, ash, and blood
          into valuable ironbone and bloodsteel. These are viewed as more honourable
          counterparts to common iron and steel, as they continue to bring honour to
          those who have fallen in combat.</p>
        <div class="adjacent_images"> <img src="screenshots/stone_circle.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/altar_storms.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/sun_orrery.png" alt="" /> <img src="screenshots/icecrystal_sanctum.png" alt="" /></div>
        <p>The other places of power include the Stone Circle, Altar of Storms, Icecrystal
          Sanctum, and Sun &amp; Stars Orrery. With the exception of the Icecrystal Sanctum,
          all of these places of power <em>must</em> be constructed outside. These places are
          used mostly for Dreamwalkers to attempt Spirit Journeys to learn spells, once
          the clan owns a copy of the proper dreamwalking codex. All reactions at the
          Places of Power are governed by MAGIC_NATURE skill, so workshop profiles can be
          used to lock out non-adepts.</p>
        <p>Some reactions at places of power require a dreamwalker talisman; each talisman is
          formed by weaving the soul of a fallen foe into material form by a dreamwalker
          at a totem pole. This is an automatic reaction, but only greater souls can be
          used for this purpose. The souls of animals and lesser foes are of no use to
          dreamwalkers.      </p>
