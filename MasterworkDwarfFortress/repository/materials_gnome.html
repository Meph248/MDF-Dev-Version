<p>Surprisingly enough, gnomes produce only one new material, plastic. Plastic is a synthetic type of wood, created from either peat or oil and serves as a surrogate wood type. Plastic logs can be used just like wooden logs for all types of constructions and reactions. It is produced in the Screw Press.</p>
        <p>Gnomes do need a lot of very specific materials for their gadgets, ranging from glass discs for dynamos to magnetic types of metal used to create electromagnets. Having a wide variety and always ordering lots of metals from caravans can help prevent shortages.</p>
        <p>You might need a lot of wood or plastic for the windmills and waterwheels needed to generate power, and many boulders will sacrifice their life to create countless mechanisms.</p></td>
