<h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
<br>
In order to quickly learn the workflow of this application, follow
these step-by-step instructions.<br>
<br>
<h3>Overview.</h3>
The way Dwarf Fortress creates worlds is by generating a series of
random maps and combining them to describe the world in detail. For
each type of map thrown into the mix, PerfectWorldDF allows you to
customize the map before sending it into DF to kick off the
world&rsquo;s history. The maps you can create with PerfectWorldDF
are one or all of the following:<br>
<br>
* Elevation Map<br>
* Rainfall Map<br>
* Drainage Map<br>
* Volcanism Map<br>
* Savagery Map <br>
<br>
Note: Dwarf Fortress also uses a Temperature Map, but as this is
heavily modified inside the game in an unpredictable way (i.e. north or
south pole) it is not currently useful to import pre-set map values for
this map.<br>
<h3>Step 1.</h3>
Before starting the application, make a backup of your world_gen.txt
file in your df_xx_xx\data\init folder. This is the file that PW will
edit in generating your worlds. I can&rsquo;t guarantee this
software will be bug free now or later, and it&rsquo;s wise to
backup this file so you don&rsquo;t have to download a whole new
version package just because your world_gen.txt file should become
unusable. So in case I made a mistake somewhere, make a copy of this
file and put it somewhere safe. Simple making a copy and renaming it in
the same directory should be fine.<br>
<br>
<h3>Step 2.</h3>
Start the application and go to the Elevation Map tab. All of the
settings and sliders are set by default to values that are good for
making a basic map, so all you have to do for now is press a few
buttons to make a usable Dwarf Fortress world.<br>
<br>
Press the &lsquo;Generate New Turbulence Field&rsquo; button.
Turbulence is like noise, but slightly different. It&rsquo;s good
for making formations that look like mountain ranges. For a more
detailed explanation, see the reference page for the Elevation Map Tab.<br>
<br>
Press the &lsquo;Generate New Noise Field&rsquo; button. This
second noise field has several uses, but for now it just adds
turbulence on a smaller scale to add some detail.<br>
<br>
On either of the noise maps, and on any of the noise maps on the other
tabs, you may left click and drag on the field to change the postion of
the noise features. The performance of this operation is fairly slow,
so you'll have to wait a couple of seconds to see where things will end
up.<br>
<br>
When you are done, you should get an elevation map that looks something
like this or similar:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Elevation Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Elevation%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 3.</h3>
Go to the Rainfall Map tab. Here you have a decision to make. You
should select a direction for the prevailing wind to bring moisture to
your world. In general, it looks best to have the wind coming off the
water, where the wind can gather moisture before casting it upon the
land as it passes over. So use the angle control to select a wind
direction that you think suits your world.<br>
<br>
Now press the &lsquo;Generate Rain Shadow Map&rsquo; button.
This will distribute rainfall on your rainfall map according to the
direction you have chosen. Notice that higher elevations will tend to
block moisture and cause most of it to fall on the windward side of any
hills or mountains. It is a rather simplified model of orographic
precipitation, but it can help give a realistic and fun quality to the
final world.<br>
<br>
Before we move on, press the &lsquo;Generate New Noise
Field&rsquo; button. This map can be used to randomize the result
of the rain shadow map a bit to get rid of any unsightly straight
lines. Pretty much every map has a secondary noise field that can be
used for this purpose, or else you can adjust the weights of the maps
to only use noise if you prefer.<br>
<br>
When you are done, your rainfall map should look like this:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Rainfall Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Rainfall%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 4.
</h3>
Go to the Drainage Map tab. This map is used in conjunction with the
rainfall map to determine what biomes are present on a particular world
square. Rainfall determines how much water arrives in a tile, and
drainage determines how long it stays around. Different stuff happens
depending on these two variables.<br>
<br>
Press the &lsquo;Generate Elevation Standard Deviation
Map&rsquo; button. Generally, the slope of the land determines how
quickly water will run off. Areas that are steep will lose water
quickly and erode, while flatter areas will collect this runoff and
silt up, acting like a sponge.<br>
<br>
Press the &lsquo;Generate New Noise Field&rsquo; button for the
usual added randomness.<br>
<br>
When you are done, you should have something like this:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Drainage Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Drainage%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 5.</h3>
Go to the Volcanism Map tab. Press the &lsquo;Generate Elevation
Cusp Map&rsquo;. This will set most of the volcanism at certain
elevation &lsquo;cusps&rsquo; so that the volcanism happens
most often at a certain altitude level that you can adjust with the
cusp sliders.<br>
<br>
Press the &lsquo;Generate New Noise Field&rsquo; button. This
is like before, but in this case you generally want a fairly high level
of noise. High volcanism also brings igneous extrusive rock layers, and
you might not want that everywhere that mountain meets the lower
elevations if that&rsquo;s where you set the cusp.<br>
<br>
When you are done, you&rsquo;ll have one of the prettier maps like
this:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Volcanism Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Volcanism%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 6. </h3>
Go to the Savagery Map tab. Press the &lsquo;Generate Savagery
Gradient Map&rsquo; button. By applying a gradient to the savagery
map, you can make things more wild as you go east or west or toward or
away a certain map location.<br>
<br>
Once again press the &lsquo;Generate New Noise Field&rsquo;
button. Again you usually want a high level of noise for this because
civilizations won&rsquo;t settle in savage areas, and if you crowd
them into a small geographical area they tend to kill each other. Its
fun to watch on your historical maps and legends, but the result can be
a rather non-diverse and possibly boring world.<br>
<br>
When you are done, you&rsquo;ll have a nice rainbow colored map
like this:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Savagery Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Savagery%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 7.</h3>
Ok, now it&rsquo;s time to finally see some preliminary results! Go
to the Biome Map tab and see how things are turning out. If you went
here earlier, you probably would have seen just a field of endless
mountains, because we had yet to actually give this tab any meaningful
input. Now that we have, we can get an idea of how this map will look
inside the Dwarf Fortress game. Ultimately, the game will apply some
erosion and humans and dwarves will build roads and chop down trees so
the end result might look somewhat different, but this will give you a
good idea.<br>
<br>
Now that you have generated all the different maps in the set, you can
save your work. Go to the File menu, and select &lsquo;Save Map Set
As&rsquo;. PerfectWorldDF map set files are in a binary format with
the *.pwset file extension.<br>
<br>
The biome map:<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Biome Tab Screenshot"
 src="Images/Biome%20Map%20Tab.jpg"><br>
<h3>Step 8.</h3>
The last tab we will look at is a rather intimidating mess. The Map
Parameters tab is where we can edit all the fields that are defined in
the world_gen.txt file. You won&rsquo;t need to know what most of
these fields do, but I&rsquo;ll go over a couple of the important
ones. Here is where we also decide which maps will be generated by
PerfectWorldDF and which ones will be generated by Dwarf Fortress. You
can actually pick and choose where each map is generated but I
don&rsquo;t really know when you would want that since all the maps
depend somewhat on the elevation map. If you do, it&rsquo;s there.<br>
<br>
To import the world_gen.txt map, go to the File menu and select
&lsquo;Import world_gen File&rsquo;. Navigate to your Dwarf
Fortress directory and find world_gen.txt in the data\init folder. Now
that you have imported the world_gen.txt file, you can start editing
the fields, but don&rsquo;t just yet.<br>
<br>
We want to generate a medium sized (129x129) map for this
demonstration, but we don&rsquo;t want to overwrite the default
settings in case we want to look at them later, so we will create a new
param set for our new map. First use the text list box labeled
&lsquo;Name:&rsquo; to select the param set called
&lsquo;MEDIUM_REGION&rsquo;. This param set has the world_gen
settings appropriate for a 129x129 world with a high percentage of land
tiles. We want to copy these settings into a new param set. When we
type a new param set name into the text list box and press the
&lsquo;enter&rsquo; key, it will create a new param set by that
name with the same settings as the param set previously selected. So in
the screenshot below you can see that I have a param set called
&lsquo;MyWorld&rsquo; that so far is an exact copy of the param
set &lsquo;MEDIUM_REGION&rsquo;. Make sure you press and
release the &lsquo;enter&rsquo; key, or the new param set will
not be made and you&rsquo;ll end up editing the
&lsquo;MEDIUM_REGION&rsquo; param set which is not ideal. If
you do this on accident you should re-import the world_gen.txt file and
start over so we can keep our clean param set.<br>
<img style="width: 862px; height: 708px;" alt="Map Params Screenshot"
 src="Images/Map%20Parameters%20Tab.jpg"><br>
Now, in order to use the maps we just generated, we want to mark the
checkboxes for each map from PerfectWorldDF that we want to use, and
leave blank any maps that we want Dwarf Fortress to generate. For now,
just check them all. The maps you are using will be indicated in the
table just above the checkmarks.<br>
<br>
Before we do a final export, there are some parameter fields that we
want to look at so we can start you off with a bit of control. The
number of caves in your world is a very important number. The default
numbers from the MEDIUM_REGION should be pretty good numbers, but if
you find that the world gen process is unusually short, you might turn
the total number of caves down. Caves are home to terrible civilization
destroying creatures who can easily get the upper hand and destroy all
civilizations in the first few years of the age of myth. Turn these
numbers way up and you&rsquo;ll find that the world gen process
will last only a few seconds! That is because very few historical
figures will be born into the world.<br>
<br>
Another area to look at is the number of peaks and volcanoes.
You&rsquo;ll find these on the parameters tab named &lsquo;Map
Generation&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t really know what peaks do but
we all know how much dwarves love volcanoes! With PW maps you should
usually have plenty of room for these things. Set the fields labeled
&lsquo;Minimum Number Of Peaks&rsquo; and &lsquo;Minimum
Number Of Volcanoes&rsquo; to 20 each. These fields are not really
minimums, they are exactly how many will be placed.<br>
<br>
Also on the &lsquo;Map Generation&rsquo; tab you will find a
table for setting the numbers of good and evil map squares. Good and
evil regions are fun! I should explain these numbers a bit, because
they are both quirky and useful. The desired number of map squares is
exactly that, how many squares in each region size category that you
want. For small and medium regions, this is easy to control. For large
regions, it&rsquo;s a lot more difficult. Large regions have a
large range of sizes, and no matter what number you use, you never know
if you&rsquo;ll end up with one region or many regions. If you max
these numbers out, all large regions will be good or evil, if you set
these numbers to 1, you will have exactly 1 large region that is good
and 1 that is evil. Personally I find that setting the medium region
numbers to high values gives me what I&rsquo;m looking for. Keep in
mind that dwarves only settle in Neutral mountain regions, so if you
have &lsquo;Playable Civ Required&rsquo; (on the &lsquo;Map
Rejection&rsquo; tab) set to yes, you need some neutral mountain
ranges or the map will be rejected.<br>
<br>
Now that we are ready to export, from the File menu select
&lsquo;Export world_gen file&rsquo;. Your new world_gen.txt
file is ready to use! You may now close PWDF or minimize it. You will
be prompted to save your maps if you close, but you can say no unless
you really want to keep them.<br>
<br>
<h3>Step 9.</h3>
Now fire up Dwarf Fortress and select the option &lsquo;Design New
World with Parameters&rsquo;. Then select your new param set that
you made and press enter, sit back and watch your new world come alive!
