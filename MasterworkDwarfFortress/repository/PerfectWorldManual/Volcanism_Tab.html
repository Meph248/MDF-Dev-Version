<h1>The Volcanism Map Tab.</h1>
This tab is where we create the volcanism map which determines where
volcanoes are likely to appear, and also where igneous extrusive rock
layers are found.<br>

<br>
The Zoom Level control will zoom in all maps associated with this tab.
Zooming in will change the size of the edit brush so that the edit
reticle cursor always shows the extent of the brushes effect.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Percent Below Igneous Extrusive Threshold&rsquo;
slider controls the threshold above which igneous extrusive rock layers
are found. <br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Percent Below Volcano Threshold&rsquo; slider
controls the threshold above which volcanoes may appear. Everything
above this threshold is set to &lsquo;100&rsquo; in the
volcanism map export to your world_gen.txt file.<br>
<br>
This map uses a &lsquo;cusp&rsquo; map for generation that
basically sets two elevations where the maximum volcanism occurs. In
this case it&rsquo;s actually easier to show rather than explain.
Play with the cusp sliders a bit so you can see what the effects are.<br>
<br>
The noise map control is the same as on other tabs, although on this
map you would likely want more noise to randomize things a bit more. It
may be undesirable to have all the world&rsquo;s volcanism on a
specific elevation, but rather drawn towards it.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;weight&rsquo; slider governs how much of this noise
map is added to the final map.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Feature Size&rsquo; slider adjusts the size of the
features in the noise field. The higher the number, the smaller the
features get. If that seems awkward, the slider is actually controlling
&lsquo;frequency&rsquo; directly, and size indirectly as a
result of frequency.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Smoothness&rsquo; slider adjusts the smoothness of
the noise field.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Generate New&rsquo; buttons scramble the noise
inputs to create a new noise field.<br>
<br>
You may also click and drag on the noise fields to adjust their
position in case you want a certain feature to appear in a specific
location.<br>
