<h1>The Options Tab.</h1>
The options tab currently has two options: <br>
<br>
You may select a different character set file for the biome map tab.
The default char set is Kjammer_square_16x16 from the Dwarf Fortress
Wiki, which is what I use for my forts. If the file you chose is moved
or gets deleted, it will revert back to Kjammer.<br>
<br>
You may also select an autosave interval. I would hate to see people
waste time and lose their hard work, especially since the brush editing
is so beastly and time consuming, so I put in an autosave feature. It
will save your current map set and settings in a file called
autosave.pwset located in your save folder. Setting this time interval
to zero will disable the autosave feature.
