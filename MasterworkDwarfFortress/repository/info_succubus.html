<h1>Plump Helmet Men</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" height="63" width="755" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time,
averaging 5 per female.&nbsp; If you're not careful, they may
attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their
numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate
area.&nbsp; If they realize that they are the majority, they will
rebel.&nbsp; It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they
are the majority.&nbsp; This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
- A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.&nbsp; They
will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping
creatures.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like
vampires.&nbsp; This effect lasts for half a year after the
rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the
creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run
away.&nbsp; Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once,
so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly
outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
- Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going
berserk.&nbsp; Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were
not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
- Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance
of inflicting necrosis on themselves.&nbsp; This will generate
miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
- PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
- Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture,
because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
- Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky
strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they
will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
- Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is
now docile.&nbsp; However, they may choose to attack one on their
own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the
ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
- Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
- The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture
them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the
dwarves that pass by.&nbsp; Large numbers of tame animals can also
prevent PHM from rebelling.&nbsp; Separating them into small groups
can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of
guards that have been in combat.&nbsp; Or you could go the simplest
method: just eat them!</p>

<h1 align="left">Succubi</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">The
succubi are human sized creatures will demonic properties. They escaped
the abyss at the beginning of history, enjoying the freedom the
surface gave them. They love wandering great palaces where gem windows
meet finely decorated furniture and producing the most exquisite works
of art imaginable. But in
the underground lie complex dungeons, where the succubi perform dark
rituals related to their heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The race has an heavy
gender inbalance of 9 females to
1 male. This leads to your fort getting few children to take care of.
However, you should be careful to protect married couples and their
children as a tragedy can lead to simultaneous tantrums.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gameplay
wise, the civilization is between dwarves and warlocks. You will be
able to upgrade your fighters with powerful spells, and use creatures for military or civilian uses. Production and management
however is closer to a standard vanilla game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Civilian succubi are
lazy
and will take long breaks, but their good intelligence will let them
produce fine goods for you. As an alternative to
migrants, they
can turn other races into half breeds using the Den of Iniquity. In
addition to the basic succubi attributes, converted prisoners retain
perks from their former race. Such corrupted prisoners will always join your
civilization immediately, acting like a citizen.</p>
<h2><strong>Skills</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The succubi are exceptionally good
at several skills, learning those at
an increased rate depending of their former race.
A pure succubus does not have the same advantages as a former dwarf or
human for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure succubi learn sorcery and animal training
quickly.</li>
<li>Cambions (elf)&nbsp;are good ambushers and
archers but not great miners.</li>
<li>Devils (human)&nbsp;are good traders.</li>
<li>Fiends (dwarf) are good mechanics,&nbsp;miners
and melee fighters. They are also immune to antracite dust.</li>
<li>Hellions (goblin) are good lashers and do not need to eat.</li>
<li>Imps (kobold) are great dodgers, knife users,
swimmers and ambushers but have a small frame.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat:&nbsp;</strong>
The succubi have
good strength and great agility, but their endurance is lacking.&nbsp;They do not bite,
instead using health draining kisses that causes a dimming syndrome.</p><p align="left">They
hit quickly in battle, landing crippling blows before their
enemies have the time to react, heavily armored or faster units however will be a problem as a succubus cannot handle damage.</p><p align="left">Their
poor
focus on
the other hand make them average archers at best. On the other hand,
they are immune to fire and magma so if it safe to melt your foes away.</p>
<h2><strong>Pets</strong></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pets are an important
feature for the civ.
You
will&nbsp;have a choice of creatures at the embark screen including
underground creatures plus a few select demonic entities. All
those creatures can be summoned in your fort by building a summoning
circle and seeking the items required for their arrival.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For more information on
each available pet, <a href="pets_succubus.html">see the
pets section</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Nobles</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Queen,
baron, count, duke,</span> the usual nobles. They contribute
little besides issuing mandates... for now. They can also appoint a champion.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Matriarch / Mistress</span>, the selected leader of your dungeon, they will
conduct meetings with unhappy workers and diplomats.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lady
of Pain</span>, the leader of your military, you might need her
quickly, but
you will be hard pressed to meet her standards. Treat her well and she
will be happy to terminate your enemies.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle
guides</span> will lead your military squads under
the command of the lady of pain. They will all ask for a tomb
so their names and feats are remembered.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforcer
/ Guardian,</span> the lawgiver of your dungeon. She will manage
your jail as usual.
When 50 succubi have settled inside the walls, the guardian can build a
squad to keep the tiny order a dungeon full of demons can support.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whipper</span>s
handle capital punishment. When she is not whipping criminals, she
will 'deal' with unhappy workers to help her mistress.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeper
of secrets</span>, the manager and book keeper in the same role.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attorney</span>,
the assigned
broker and merchant. She will measure your wealth and will sell
your unwanted items, once she is done drinking, sleeping and partying.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Champion,</span> she should lead combat demonstrations in addition to the battle guides.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overseer</span>, with no function, this position can be used for succession games.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Magic</strong></h2>
<p align="left"><strong></strong>Magic
is learned one skill at a time at the Temple of Sin or Fire. Use the
workshop profile to select who will get the upgrade then run the
associated reaction to give your succubus the new interactions. Remember
to put the military off duty if you are trying to upgrade a soldier.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, there are global
effects
in the Infernal chamber or the Eerie glowing canal, timing those
reactions will make a difference between victory or a crushed fort.</p>
<h2><strong>Tech</strong></h2>
<p align="left">The
more advanced buildings have a multitude of sources. Some require
magma, others blueprints or special items traded using the Attorney's
stock. You can spawn magma using a magma well, this will enable the construction of magma forges.</p>
<h2><strong>Important stuff</strong></h2>
<p align="left">You
will be attacked early. Very early! So start preparing defences
immediately! Otherwise you must be playing with temperature ON. I also
recommend disabling diseases as there is currently&nbsp;no means to
fight those.</p>
<p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF
has&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;invader race,
Goblins. MasterworkDF has&nbsp;<strong>sixteen</strong>.
This means up a lot more !FUN!, snatchers, thieves, sieges and
ambushes.
Again, these are optional. You can even add another&nbsp;<strong>fifteen</strong> fortress
defence races to it.</p>
