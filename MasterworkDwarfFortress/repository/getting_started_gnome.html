        <p>Gnomes: Small, but excellent with animals and machines. If you like to stay out of the way while fending off enemies with animals and traps, the gnomish race will suit you well. Start out by recruiting allies from the surrounding wildlife, sniff around in the earth for gems and metals, and advance to creating self-sustaining production factories, metallic automaton sentinels, and more traps than your enemies know how to deal with.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>The Embark Site</strong></p>
        <p>Picking a good embarking site is essential for gnomes. You're going to want a power source - a nearby river will be extremely useful. Warm temperatures year-round are also a good choice - if the river freezes, so will your water wheels. Wood is an important resource, so try and pick a heavily forested embark. Gnomes are at peace with natural wildlife, so embarking in a savage biome may be worthwhile - but watch out for any supernatural or intelligent roaming monsters! In addition, many gnomish upgrades require large amounts of metal, so embarking in a spot with good mining is also important.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>The Embark Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>When it comes to skills, you'll want to focus mainly on things that will help you get a good, solid, trap-filled fortress up and running quickly. Fast miners and mechanics will be useful, and high-level machine operators can perform feats with some of the machines that other gnomes cannot (drawing water up from further down using the Drilling Rig, for instance). At least one high-level animal trainer is also an excellent choice, as it will make recruiting wildlife much easier. Military skills can probably be ignored, since gnomes won't be winning many direct fights anyway.</p>
        <p>Aside from skills, the items you bring with you will be very important. Picking the right resources will let you skip some steps in your advancement. For instance, taking an oscilloscope with you will greatly aid in your search for resources early on. Nickel is also much more valuable than its price would suggest, as it can be used for magnets. Don't forget to check the embark profiles: Tinker's Toys has items oriented toward producing automatons, Technological Arms Race will let you build either a railgun or a Thunder Coil early on, and with Clockwork Nirvana you can have a Cosmic Gear up and running within a month or two.</p>
        <p>Gnome mode includes several premade embark profiles to choose from:</p>

if (document.getElementById(element).style.display == "none") {
document.getElementById(element).style.display = "";
} else {
document.getElementById(element).style.display = "none";
}
}

        </div>
        <div id="hidden" style="display:none;">
         <hr align="center" />  <p align="center">Little People of the Forest</p>
        <p align="center">A small band of gnome druids and their animal friends are sent forth to consult with the wildlife in a choice location, to protect them and to teach them to protect themselves against the careless ecological destruction of the Big People.  You have little in the way of practical crafting skills, but with three high-level druids and a fair number of pets, persuading the local wildlife to join your settlement shouldn't take long.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Wisdom of the Earth</p>
        <p align="center">Rumor has it that the earth in your chosen location is rich with, well, riches, and gnomes love gold and gems almost as much as they love animals.  Set out with a team of miners and archeologists to uncover the buried treasure hidden beneath your feet, along with jewelers and metalsmiths ready to turn it into valuable trade goods.  Make good use of the geological seismograph and the excavation site - both will help you zero in on the valuables.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Tinker's Toys</p>
        <p align="center">A typical scouting/trading expedition, with miners, craftsgnomes, and carpenters... and a pair of talented tinkers who are quite possibly crazy, but if anyone knows the value of crazy, it's the gnomes.  They've brought a boxful of assorted odds and ends with them.  Who knows what kind of strange and wonderous gadgets they will make when inspiration strikes?</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Technological Arms Race</p>
        <p align="center">An adventurous and danger-seeking scouting team has been sent deep into hostile territory.  Fortunately, small and peace-loving people as they are, the gnomes are no slouch when it comes to defense.  You have enough equipment with you to build the latest and greatest weapons known to gnomekind (and possibly the world), and a pair of sharpshooters with the skills to use them.  Prepare for trouble.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">Clockwork Nirvana</p>
        <p align="center">Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is simple - to head out into the world and construct the greatest gnome artifice ever made.  An clockwork paradise of moving parts, minecarts, and automated factories such as the world has never seen - an eternal testament to gnomish ingenuity.  A team of architects, carpenters, masons, engravers, miners, and mechanics will aid you.  But that's not all - you have with you a stable fragment of warpstone, a key ingredient in constructing the ultimate in gnome experimental technology, the Cosmic Gear.  Build it, and you will soon have all the time in the world.  Maybe.</p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Step 1: Collect Resources</strong></p>
        <p>The early game is pretty standard stuff. Cut down trees, dig a hole, stockpile your goods and start making furniture. There are two priorities that you'll want to focus on when playing as gnomes, though. First off, set up a Nature Shrine as soon as possible, a short distance away from your main settlement (so that your pets don't scare off the wildlife) and set 'Commune with Animals' on repeat. This will hopefully earn you some new pets, and if you're lucky you might find a Druidic Token, which can be used for other pet-related things. Second, make a Mechanic's Workshop and start cranking out mechanisms. You'll need as many of them as you can get, whether for standard traps or automated machines.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you brought a bit of raw glass with you; if not, you'll have to wait until you come across a rough gem, which shouldn't take too long. Set up a Tinker's Workshop and make yourself a lens. Start building Excavation Sites scattered around your underground base, and use the lens to prospect the stone around you. Press 'A' to read the report once it comes in. That should help you locate valuable resources quickly.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Step 2: Phone Home</strong></p>
        <p>You'll want to find some metal as soon as possible - if you don't make a Seismic Telegraph, which requires a heavy metal piston, gnome traders will never come, and migrants will stop showing up after the first two waves, nipping your settlement in the bud.</p>
        <p>Once you find some metal, make a piston, build a seismic telegraph, and send a request for traders. If it doesn't work the first time, keep trying until you get a message saying that a caravan is coming. Now you can relax.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Step 3: Play it Safe</strong></p>
        <p>Gnomes are very vulnerable. You're going to want to have a strong, solid infastructure before you even start to deal with enemies. Wildlife shouldn't be an issue unless you embarked in an evil area (if you did, good luck!), but invaders will show up sooner or later and you'll need a way to deal with them. Sealing yourself off may be a good idea, at least early on - on the other hand, staying outside will make it easier to recruit pets. Set up lots of traps to catch intruders, but make sure there's a way for traders to get in. If you spot a bird on your map, select the 'Ask bird for news' option at the Nature Shrine to get hints about what will be showing up in the next few months. This will help you plan ahead.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Step 4: Advance</strong></p>
        <p>Once you've got a safe hole, you'll want to start advancing. If you've managed to find a Druidic Token at the Nature Shrine, you might want to consider setting up an Advanced Animal Training Area and start training a team of furry fighters to defend your fort. On the other hand, maybe you want to step up your production by setting up a chain of automatic machines. Or perhaps you'd like to make some more use of the Excavation Site to dig up some valuable gems and start a jewelry business. Maybe you want to harness electricity and make high-powered technological weaponry that will let you take down enemies five times your size? Or reduce your dependency on wildlife by making some robot animals of your own? Or create the ultimate deathtrap fortress? The choice is yours...</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Step 5: Profit!</strong></p>
      <p>Gnomes have a lot of options. The more complicated, the more moving parts, the more automated and ingenious and ludicrously, pointlessly convoluted your defense plan is, the better. The gnome race was made from the bottom up to cater to those who love the complexity of Dwarf Fortress' machines and who like to maximize their creative potential. So by all means, go nuts. This isn't just Dwarf Fortress. This is Gnome Artifice.</p></td>
