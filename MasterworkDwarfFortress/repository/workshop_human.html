        <p><strong>Weight Bench        </strong></p>
        <p>The weight bench takes bars and allows units to train with them. It will raise their athletic skill, which allows them to train faster. It also raises their physical attributes, making this a good exercise for soldiers that are off duty.</p>
        <hr />
<p><strong>Wood Splitting Block</strong></p>
<p>The wood block can cut rough wood into blocks and make wood from gnarled roots your miners might uncovers. Its a very basic workshop and can best be build next to the wood stockpile. It has an automatic reaction to cut rough wood into smooth wood, which is labor intensive. If you do not care for the quality of your wood, you can just ignore this building.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Brick Splitting Block</strong></p>
<p>Has only one reaction: Split a boulder into 8 blocks. An essential buildings for quick aboveground constructions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Deons Tavern</strong></p>
<p>Your workers can use instruments to transform into a bard playing music. He will stay near the tavern and give every passerby a bonus, for one month. Different instruments give different songs.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>- Speed (+25%) </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>- Courage (nofear, noexert) </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>- Battle (+15% strength, agility endurance) </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>- Fighting (likes fighting) </strong><strong>- No Food/Drink (no food, no drink)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>- Controlling (calms berserking dwarves, slows and give noemotions) </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>- No Sleep (no sleep, no stun, no paralyze)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> - Luck (250% more luck)</strong></p>
<p>You can hire adventurers in the tavern. It costs a lot of gold, but will spawn a new unit with pre-set skills and equipment. Most of them also have unique abilities. You might have these special human castes as migrants. They cant join normal guilds, so keep that in mind. You have access to 8 adventurers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warrior</li>
  <li>The warrior has 5 points in shield, armor and sword skill and 10 in melee combat. He has above average strength and endurance and spawns with a full set of silk clothing, steel armor, a steel shield and long sword.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Ranger</li>
  <li>The ranger has 10 points in ranged combat and hunting, and 5 points in bow usage. He has above average agility, and spawns with a full set of silk clothing, hardened leather armor, quiver, 25 steel bolts and a steel recurve bow.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Bard</li>
  <li>The bard has legendary 15 skill points in playing music. Who would have thought. Its an unused social skill, its more flavor than anything else. He spawns with a full set of silk clothing, and gives everyone around him +15% strength and +15% endurance, as well as no fear and likes fighting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Monk</li>
  <li>The monk has legendary 15 skill points in striking, kicking and dodging, as well as 10 in praying. He is sterile and never fathers kids, and spawns with a silk robe, pants and shoes. He has above average focus and spatial sense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Cleric</li>
  <li>The cleric has 3 points in all medical skills as well as hammer combat. She give everyone around her a 100%+ bonus to recuperation, which means that units heal wounds twice as fast. Thats not important in combat, but a hospital run by her will be twice as effective. She spawns with silk robes, pants and shoes, but no weapon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Mage</li>
  <li>The mage has legendary 15 skill points in magic weapon usage and spawns with a steel mage staff, silk robes, pants and shoes. She can use two spells, hailstorm and waterbolt, both projectile attacks with range 20. No friendly fire, very safe to use.</li>
</ul>

  <li>The conjurer has no special skill points and spawns only with a silk robe, pants and shoes. She does randomly spawn mephits, small scaly elemental demons, around her; on average 5 a year. These come in 4 types, fire, ice, acid and air, and can be farmed for scales and meat, or used as guard animals.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sacred Altar</strong></p>
<p>The altar allows your humans to pray to their gods. You can see which god a unit has in their relations screen. Pray to a god worshiped by your civilization, and then pray or sacrifice items to improve your merit and increase the belief level of your citizens.  When your merit and belief is high enough, the god may intervene on your behalf.  Every sphere will have a different effect on gameplay, so choose your idols with care.  A god of metals may increase your smelting efficiency, while a god of agriculture may increase crop yields, a god of chaos may cause your enemies to fight among themselves, and a volcano god is likely to be a lot of !!fun!!</p>
<p>If you stop praying, the power of the gods will decrease over time.</p>
<p>The altar has the ability to bless silver, creating either moonsilver, which heavily damages evil creatures, or shadesilver, which heavily damages good creatures. All you need is a bar of silver.</p>
<p>You can sacrifice 10 souls for one of three blessings by the gods: Work, Peace, War or Safety. They will give a positive effect that affects all humans. Work is great if you have a safe fortress and a blooming industry, Peace is great if you are threatened by tantrums and civil unrest, and War is a good boost to your military.</p>
<hr />
        <p><strong>Merchant Stall (local)</strong></p>
        <p>Merchant stalls are basic workshops that only require blocks to be build. They enable you to sell or buy materials or items. Its very straightforward, you put in items or coins, and get back items or coins.</p>
        <p>Weapons, Trapcomps, Clothing and Crafts are a bit special. They have a voucher system, allowing you to buy and sell items of different materials. You first buy vouchers with a specific material, lets say steel. You can then buy items with these vouchers, giving you a steel item. Or you sell items, which gives you vouchers back in their material, enabling you to buy new items made of these materials. If you sell 100 bronze daggers, you get 100 bronze vouchers, enabling you to buy a lot of bronze items.</p>
        <p>Here the list of merchants. 15 in total.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wood</li>
          <li>Food</li>
          <li>Drink</li>
          <li>Leather</li>
          <li>Textile</li>
          <li>Clothing</li>
          <li>Stone</li>
          <li>Gem</li>
          <li>Ore</li>
          <li>Metal</li>
          <li>Pet (Buy only)</li>

        <p><strong>Merchant Stall (foreign)</strong></p>
        <p>Foreign merchant stalls require a contract to be rented out. You can buy a contract from any visiting caravan. It would be best to order lots of them from their liaisons. They come in different prices, sometimes you are lucky, sometimes it might get expensive. They allow you to rent a merchant stall for 3 months, netting you an income of 500 gold directly. After that time the workshop will revert back to normal.</p>
        <p>Most of them are straightforward, but a few I want to mention: You can ransom hostages from goblins, giving you more workers. Monoliths act like your own necromancers, kobold trading is pretty hit and miss, especially their toad shots, which is a very special drink. Dwarven tears and bloods of armok give access to water and magma spawning, while elven songs can regrow all grass and trees on the map. Gnomish cage-o-matics are ranged weapons that shoot cages and trap targets, and the human trader can sell race-specific contracts. This can unlock race-workshops you otherwise cant access, because the race might have died out.</p>

        <p><strong>Council</strong></p>
        <p>The council is a basic workshop that allows to control emigration and migration. You can call migrants, which costs 5000 gold coins, and might result in an additional migration wave.</p>
        <p>Emigration has four setting: No, little, medium and a lot. This allows unhappy people to leave the fort, instead of going insane and tantruming all the time. They turn &quot;friendly&quot; and leave with the next caravan. They probably take their family with them, so take care. It is a good solution to over-population though.</p>
        <p>Asking for public opinion gives you an announcement with the most common negative thought, which makes it easier to find out what you can change to make people happier.</p>

<p>The merchants guild has a unique feature: For each upgrade it allows you to buy 2 new contracts from specific races. When you first build it, you can buy human and dwarven contracts. After the update you unlock elven and gnome, then goblin and kobold, then orc and drow and in the end succubi and warlock contracts. They cost progressively more with one version, but allow you to unlock their workshops without having to rely on caravans. An alternative is the human merchant, who sells random contracts as well.</p>

        <hr />
        <div align="center" id="spoiler1" style="display:none">
          <h1>lump Helmet Men</h1>
          <p align="center"><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" width="755" height="63" /></p>
          <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
          <p><br />
            - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
          <p><br />
            - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
          <p><br />
            - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>
