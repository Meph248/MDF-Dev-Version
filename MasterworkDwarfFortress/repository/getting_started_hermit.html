        <p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Since this is a challenge mode intended for experienced players, there is not much to say. You can take as many items as you like, making it harder or easier for your start. Mind that all the pets are male, you cant embark with breeding animals. You will also start the game naked and cant pick clothing at embark, so best to take some leather or cloth to quickly make a shirt, pants and shoes. </p>
        <p>If you want to add specific skills to your hermit, you have to give them to all seven units, because a random one will survive as the hermit.</p>
        <p><strong>After the embark:</strong> First thing you will notice is that six hallucinations leave &quot;past regrets&quot;, which need to be buried. If you dont do that your hermit will be haunted by ghosts, which might kill him. He will also be very unhappy about the deaths of his imaginary friends, but quickly realizes that its for the best. After about one ingame week all bad thoughts he has are removed, to give you a fresh start.</p>
        <p>Make a shovel in the Craftsman Shop, dig a hole to literally bury your past regrets, get some clothing, and start building your home. You might want to go easy on the hunting, if you want to become a druid later on.</p>
<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> Thats all yours. I added a few things to keep you busy, like the Sundail that can set gamespeed, the religion system of humans and the druidism system of gnomes, but what your end goal is... that is up to you. There are no long tech trees, no high end materials and no surpreme something you have to advance to. But there are two hardcoded events:</p>
<p>After 2 years in the game, you will get a friend.</p>
<p>After 3 years in the game, you might learn magic.</p>
