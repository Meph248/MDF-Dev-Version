        <h1>Gnomish Pets</h1>
        <p>Gnomes can tame any animal and regularily have access to all kinds of wildlife. There are no unique, specific gnome pets, instead you will see everything from bobcats over owls to alligators. Any wild surface animal can be tamed in worldgen and embarked with.</p>
        <p>While playing fort mode, random wildlife will join your forts if your druidism score is high enough, and there pets can also be trained in different combat skills and given specific commands in the Adv. Animal Training Area.</p>
<p>Gnomes can also build mechanical versions of several animals, ranging from clockwork beetles to mechanical dragons. They are made of the metals you use in the reaction and can be outfitted with different equipment. </p>

<p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
<p><br />
  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
<p><br />
  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
<p><br />
  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
<p><br />
  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
<p><br />
  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
<p><br />
  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
<p><br />
  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
<p><br />
  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
<p><br />
  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p></div>

      <h1 align="left"><a name="aa" id="aa">Taming Wild Animals</a></h1>
      <p>Gnomes are strongly connected to nature, especially animals. By treating your pets well and not allowing them to die, you will gain the ability to tame wild animals on sight and influence your pets in a number of different ways.</p>
      <p>To tame animals, go to the Nature Shrine and run the 'recruit animals from the wild' command. It is best to put your high-level druids here, as they will have a much better chance at taming creatures. The longer you run this reaction, the greater the chance of finding a Druidic Token, which is used to proceed to the next step of animal training: the Advanced Animal Training Area. If you already have an Advanced Animal Training Area, you can use it to attempt to summon all the animals on the map at once. The success of this will be dependent on your druidic merit, but it will ignore the skill of the user.</p>
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Whenever an animal is tamed, make sure to assign it a trainer, and make sure you have a (regular) animal training area available for use. If the animal reverts back to its wild state, it will generally not attack your gnomes, but it may continue to follow its original trainer around and attack your other pets, making trouble until you kill it (which will hurt your merit score) or figure out how to recapture it using a cage trap - harder than it sounds, since it will avoid all your traps. All gnomes have the animal training labor active by default, so simply assigning 'any trainer' to the animal should be enough.</p>
      <p>The Nature Shrine will allow you to do several other things: talk to birds for information about likely future events, summon fish in case you exhaust the local population, and check your current status with nature. All except the last one requires you to have at least positive nature merit. You can also release animals into the wild, which will help you raise your druidic merit. See the Tips page for more information on how to keep your druidic merit high.</p>
      <h1 align="left"><a name="aa" id="aa">Advanced Animal Training</a></h1>
      <p>At an advanced animal training area, you can influence your pets in a number of different ways. This will require you to have positive nature merit, but beyond this, the success of the activities are based on the trainer's skill. With a high-level trainer, you can train animals for hunting and war, get them to follow any unit you want, nickname them, and even raise their combat skill level.</p>
      <p>There are a number of caveats though: Some animals are easier to train for certain activities than others. Aggressive or predatory animals are easier to train for hunting or war, but they will be harder to untrain. Animals that like to travel in groups are easier to train to follow another animal. High-value pets will be hard for low-level trainers to influence to do anything.</p>
      <p>To train an animal to follow another animal, pasture the leader close to the center of the training area and the follower further away. It is easier to train a low-value animal to follow a high-value one than the other way around, but it will be harder to break them away.</p>
      <p>Training animals in combat techniques is a bit complicated. You will need to have the animal trained for hunting or war, and have a druid who also has experience in close-range, unarmed combat. Since gnomes are not by nature great unarmed combatants, it may be worthwhile to set up a 'dojo' of gnomes who spar without weapons specifically for this purpose, and give the animal training area a workshop profile that permits them in exclusively, so they will teach animals when not on military duty. They will then be able to train animals to fight up to the teacher's current level. In other words, if you have a gnome who becomes a grand master biter, that gnome can teach animals to also be grand master biters. Unlike most animal training, an animal can learn combat techniques regardless of whether or not they respect the trainer, but higher-level animal trainers will be able to teach much faster in general.</p>
      <h1>Gnomish Constructs</h1>
      <p>You can construct automatons in the clockwork automaton workshop and the automaton body shop. To build an automaton, you'll need a frame created in the Metalsmith's Forge under &quot;other objects&quot;, 2 lenses, an acuator, a clockwork device, and an artificial brain from the Tinker's Shop, and a fairly large number of mechanisms. Creating an automaton takes a lot of time and resources, but once it is created, it will serve you well. Even small, low-quality automatons are tough fighters and hard to break, to say nothing of the ones made out of high-level metals like iron or steel. Broken automatons can be dismantled and their broken mechanisms can be repaired in a Tinker's Shop with a 75% success rate, and their frame remains even when broken, so most of the resources that went into making them can be reused.</p>
      <p><strong>Models:</strong></p>
      <p>Clockwork Beetle, Scorpion,  Mouse,  Cuckoo,  Canary,  Chicken,  Cat,  Falcon,  Tortoise,  Monkey.</p>
<p>Mechanical Badger,  Dog,  Carp,  Sheep,  Panther,  Gorilla,  Spider Tank,  Shark,  Horse,  Bear,  Bull,  Crocodile,  Elephant, Dragon.</p>
