Description
===========

SoundSense is an unofficial (3rd party) sound-engine tool for the Dwarf Fortress roguelike.
It plays various sound effects, voices and music based on what entries appear in the 
gamelog.txt.

Basically, game events are detected and this triggers certain sounds and soundtracks. For 
example, specific combat events will trigger certain sound effects like the clanging of 
swords and the impact of arrows. Likewise, a change from Winter to Spring will change the 
background music.

Although it has only been tested on Windows and Linux, SoundSense should (in theory) run 
on any OS with java support. Startup scripts are included for Windows and Linux.

See this post for help on getting it to run on Mac OS X:

(Note: Feedback on using SoundSense with Mac OS X is appreciated. It has not be tested 
enough yet to warrant official support.)

Disclaimer
==========
SoundSense has been tested and I can not imagine a situation where it could cause harm. 
However, to be on the safe side: SoundSense is provided 'as is,' without warranty of any 
kind, either express or implied. You assume total responsibility for the use of the 
Software as it is entirely at your own risk.


Acknowledgment
==============
The SoundSense program itself was written (and is maintained) by Petr Prokop. But a lot of 
talented people produced, recorded and edited the music and sound that went into this 
project. They deserve our acknowledgment and appreciation, too. If you enjoy SoundSense 
and are curious to see who these people are or how many different sources we used, then 
check out ATTRIBUTION.TXT in the Soundpack.zip package for a full credits list.
