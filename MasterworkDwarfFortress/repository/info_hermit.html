                <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
                <p><br />
                  - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
                <p><br />
                  - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>

                <h1 align="left">General Info</h1>
                <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Your hermit can learn all skills in the game. He also starts with plenty of natural skills of his own. He has 5 points in Appraisal, Record Keeping, Organization, Masonry, Carpenty, Engraving, Trapping, Tanning, Brewing, Cooking, Herbalism, Woocraft, Stonecraft, Leatherworking, Bonecarving, Amor Use, Bowyer, Bow, Hunting, Tracking, Knapping, Ranged Combat, Melee Combat, Dodging, Striking, Kicking, Hivekeeping and Farming. He also has 10 points in Discipline, Student, Situational Awareness, Concentration and Coordination. </p>
                <p align="left">Embark skills are truly not that important. Since you dont know which of your 7 units is the hermit, and which are hallucinations, you would have to give each of the 7 the skills you want in the end. Fishing is quite useful for a hermit.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>You will want to stay out of combat if possible. You are alone and no one will come to help you, when you are lying unconscious and bleeding out. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> You favor the bow, both as hunting weapon and in war. It allows you to keep your distance. Otherwise you have axes, swords, hammers and spears. Choose the right weapon for the right opponent.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Arrows. You can poison them or light them on fire with a pitch brazier, or add blackpowder to allow some explosive suprises.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> Normal leather or metal armor. Get as much as you can, layers over layers. </p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> Normal materials, nothing new. No steel though, you have to salvage high-tier materials from invaders.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Dogs, Cats and Hawks. A war animal, a hunting animal and one to catch vermin. Male-version only, so you cant just embark with breeding animals and never worry about food ever again.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Should be easy, since you only have one person to feed. Hunt, fish, butcher, farm, gather... as you like.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> You are alcohol dependant, so better get some drinks going. You also have access to the handpump, a workshop that can fill barrels and buckets with water to store away for emergencies.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> The craftsman can make cheap shovel that is ok for the beginning, later on you can forge your own metal pick. You use shovels to find ore, and make an anvil in your smelter from bars.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> A savage region would be good for a druid-style play, as you get stronger warbeasts. Otherwise anything is fine, except evil regions. Their fogs and mists can easily instakill your one hermit.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> You got one noble, and that is you. He does all jobs, although he will never use the justice or healthcare system. But you can use the bookkeeper, broker, manager, militia commander and diplomat. Its all in one.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Magic: </strong>After 3 years you can learn one of three magic paths. Conjuration, Elemental Magic or Necromancy. See the Magic Altar in the building section for more info.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Religion: </strong>You can build a house shrine and consecrate it to a god your hermit worhsips. Pray to raise your merit. The more merit, the more the god might influence the hermit, for example smite down thieves and snatchers. Gods have many different abilities, depending on their spheres.</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Druidism: </strong>You can raise your nature merit by being good to animals. Nature Shrines allow you to recruit them and teach them skills or obey special commands. See the Nature Shrine in the workshop section for more details.              </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Past Regrets:</strong> Hallucinations (your 6 embark friends and the 2 migrant waves) disappear leaving these curious items. Past Regrets. For gameplay reasons they are corpses that have to by buried, otherwise your hermit will face ghosts, which might isntantly kill him by fright. You have to build coffins and bury your past regrets to stop that.</p></td>
