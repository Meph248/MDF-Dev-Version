Welcome to Stonesense Felsite(3.1)

Thank you for trying out our little visualizer,
as always, we appreciate any feedback.

Please note that stonesense is tightly bound to DFHack, and so only works for the version that
the accompanying DFHack is built for.

To run stonesense, Copy DFHack into the dwarf fortress folder, and run DwarfFortress.exe.
When DFHack console appears, type in stonesense and press enter.

When you turn on follow mode, the screen will jump to the location of the DF window.
You can adjust the position of the follow mode relative to the DF window by
holding Ctrl while using the keyboard window movement keys.

When you turn on cursor follow mode, the debug cursor will follow the DF cursor when it exists.

-- Occlusion Culling --
There is an experimental feature that hides blocks that are not visible, for a speed increase.
This is a work in progress, and very buggy. It can be turned off with 'o', if something is missing.
