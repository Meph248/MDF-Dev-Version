<p align="left">Kobolds mainly rely on leather and wood. Most of their buildings require a wooden log (as tentpole) and several pieces of leather. Hunting and butchering animals will be the main source of your building mats. Most tents can be refitted, which will only cost a single piece of leather.</p>
        <p align="left">A unique kobold materials is bonerattle, used for bonerattle armor. It is made by combining several pieces of bone and will camouflage the wearer from undeads. Undead creatures will assume the kobold wearing bonerattle armor is another zombie or skeleton running around and wont attack them.</p>
        <p align="left">Kobolds can smelt or and make basic metals, but do not have access to alloys, until they steal the tech from dwarves. You can melt and reforge the equipment of invaders to get to these alloys.</p></td>
