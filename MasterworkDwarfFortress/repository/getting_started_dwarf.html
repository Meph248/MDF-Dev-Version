        <p><strong>Before you embark:</strong> Make sure you have every setting the way you like it. Remember that the mod allows you to alter embark point and group size to your liking, and that you can embark on towns, tombs and fortresses. I personally embark with a lot of miners, but the embark preparation in MDF is not different from vanilla DF. The pets are different and I would take moleweasels as vermin hunters, and some mastiffs as guard animals.</p>
<p><strong>After the embark:</strong> Again, MDF dwarves start of just like vanilla DF dwarves, so there is nothing special you need right away. You do have a few workshops that make a fortress easier to set up though, the rock/gemforges and the 4 crafters. Stonecutter, Woodcrafter, Bonecarver and Gemcutter allow much more efficient use of these materials. </p>
<p>Since dwarves have castes, it might be worthwhile to check the Dwarf Therapist and sort by caste, and appoint labors according to that. They learn fitting labors twice as fast.</p>
<p>Buildings moats and walls, traps and siege engines, or a standing army: thats your choice. There are not many changes to vanilla DF, all your old tactics will work here as well.</p>
<p><strong>Late-Game:</strong> The later stages are where the mod content comes to shine. You can research new technologies like golems, landmines and turrets, or get your hands on magic. Build an entire industry based on religion or create your own forgotten beasts. High end invaders also leave high end rewards, and megabeasts can be reanimated to fight on your side. Dwarf mode is by far the biggest race in the mod, which means it has the most to discover.</p>
