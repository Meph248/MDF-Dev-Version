<h1 style="text-align: left;">Getting started</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">This
mod is pre-installed. Just download, unpack, that's it. When you are
reading this, you already installed the mod, congratulations. Please do
not copy it over vanilla DF or older mod versions. Just unpack it into
a new folder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To alter the mod, you
can run the
Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.exe. You will need to do this to set Succubus
as a playable race. Just open it up, click on 'Civilizations' and you will see
a large list of civilizations. Currently Dwarves, Orcs, Kobolds,
Gnomes, Warlocks, Succubi and Humans are potentially playable. Tick the box
under 'Fort Mode' and all is done.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you just want to
play one race, it is recommended to turn the other races non-playable.
It will make embarking easier, since you don't have to choose your race
ingame.</p>
<h2>A typical succubus site</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The
succubi use a mix of surface and underground features. They enjoy
expansive palaces where dark stone and gem windows meet decorated
furniture. &nbsp;Each fort in their kingdom must be treated as a
work of art.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But
the finely decorated bedrooms hide a darker secret. In the underground,
dark temples maintain a link between the surface and the horrors below,
enabling the succubi to summon powerful monsters while the witches
sacrifice the souls of their enemies for their own leisure, or their
enemies' pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If possible, succubi
prefer to embark on evil
biomes. They particulary enjoy drinking wine made from evil plants and
their cattle does not suffer there. Beware of
the undead who will never understand desires the way lust demons do.</p>
<h2>The embark preparation </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">You
will be able to live with a standard inventory. However you have to
keep in mind that sieges will start very early. So it is a good idea to
prepare one of your original succubi as a trained fighter.</span></strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>Skills</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Same as dwarves for 6 succubi:
miners,&nbsp;lumberjack,&nbsp;carpenter,&nbsp;mason,&nbsp;farmer</li>
<li>Ideally one combat capable succubus to appoint as lady
of pain.</li>
<li>Do not separate organizer and bookkeeper. The keeper
of secrets fill both roles.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Items</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard items a regular fort uses. What worked for
dwarves will work for the succubi.</li>
<li>Your succubi are not alcohol dependant so drinks are
not as vital if there is water.</li>
<li>You can buy surface plants at the embark screen.</li>
<li>A weapon and an helmet to equip your lady of pain.
Bronze is the best budget metal.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Pets</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tentacle monsters are expensive but will provides an
oil substitute, sets contaminant traps and are good fighters.</li>
<li>Orthus are similar to dogs but stronger, they can
serve as bodyguards.</li>
<li>Nahashes or rat things will hunt vermins around.</li>
<li>You might start with 1 or 2 cauchemars. Those can follow in
simple fights or provide your with early milk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>First things on the map </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">First
appoint your lady of pain and create a squad for her. Get her to
train quickly and give her two sparring mates after the first migration
waves. Be careful of her happiness however, you can dig a room for her and
making early furniture with your carpenter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Otherwise the standard
procedure of securing your supplies
and making the fort sustainable and defended apply. You must keep in
mind that 'good' guys are on the way so a drawbridge and basic defences
are a
priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Afterwards
you can slaughter your starting pack animals. Turn their skulls into
totems and you will be able to build a summoning circle to start
bringing extra beasts. Their souls can be used at the temple of sin to
offer a couple of extra moves to your warriors.</p>
<h2>Advancing </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Build
a jeweler workshop and start cutting gems. Those will let you conserve
souls at the Soul Well. Large gems also allow you to summon fire imps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The
temple of fire can add fire immunity to your warriors, combining that
with fire imps, torrid kiss or other fire interactions will give you an
edge. &nbsp;Beware of friendly fire!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also make a
worker fire immune and start
digging space for a magma reservoir with a magma well designed to pour
into it. Use your fire immune succubi to fill the reservoir. Building your
furnaces on top of those will unlock most of the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As an
alternative to immigrants, making a large quantity of cage traps will
allow you to turn prisoners into more succubi. Build their cage near a
den of iniquity and, afterwards, free them using a lever. Be careful
that their mount will remain hostile no matter what.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can seek
better armor materials, summoned basilisks can be sheared for horns.
Turning their horns into bars in the smelter will yield a metal as
strong as steel but much lighter. Basiliskine is great for armor making.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Otherwise you can make bloodsteel out of bodyparts, blood is produced at the kitchen.</p>
