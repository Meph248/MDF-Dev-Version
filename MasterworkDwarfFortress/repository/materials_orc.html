        <p align="center">You can find tables and raw-data about all metals and armor-materials in the mod on the wiki:</p>

<p>Orcs use most of the normal materials available in the mod, as well as the special new metals and woods. This is possible by raiding dwarves or drow to get access to their labor-cells, which can work these metals for you.</p>
        <p>The orcs themselves mostly work with iron and steel, mixing in handcrafted items of ironbone, bloodsteel and even mithril. Overall they have access to good metals. Lamellar leather for armor is another favourite.</p>
        <p>New, unique materials are four glasses. Ebon glass and ashlander glass which are a heavy and a light weapongrade metal, and cobalt glass and ruby glass, both decorative but with a high value. The workshop section explains where and how to produce these.</p></td>
