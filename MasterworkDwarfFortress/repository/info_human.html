                      <td width="798"><h1>Humans </h1>
  <p align="left"><strong>Skills:</strong> Human skills are the same as dwarven skills. There is nothing special you have to look out for. Just keep in mind that you are doing a lot of constructions aboveground, masons, woodcutters and carpenters will come in handy for that.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Combat: </strong>Humans are slightly larger than dwarves and average in combat. They have no special attacks, skills or magic, so just equip your soldiers well and train them in the barracks, business as usual.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Weapons:</strong> You have a large assortement of weapons, every type of one-handed melee weapon, the smiths guild can unlock two-handed weapons, but the human speciality are muskets, pistols and handcannons. For early ranged weaponry you have the standard bow.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Ammo:</strong> Arrows, Arrows, Bullets and Cannonballs. Nothing special.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Armor:</strong> You have the normal leather armors and metal breastplates, as well as full sets of padded armor, chainmail armor and plate armors, unlocked by the smiths guild. A dwarven runesmith can even engrave them with special effects.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Materials:</strong> There are no special materials that humans exclusively use. Just go with iron and steel for the most parts. Gold is the material that makes the world go round, its the most important metal. Gold coins buy everything.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Pets:</strong> Human have access to all vanilla DF pets. Cows, horses, dogs, cats, turkeys and so on. You can wartrain and armor your dogs and horses, unlocked by the farmers guild.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Food:</strong> Human eat most everything and are in that aspect exactly like dwarves. No special care needed.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Drink:</strong> Humans are not alcohol dependant, water is perfectly fine. Expensive and varied drinks will raise their mood, so dont disregard your brewery.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Digging:</strong> Dark and claustrophobic underground tunnels leave negative effects on humans. After 1 ingame week they get a 50% speed malus, because of the dark, and if left for several weeks underground they get dizzy. They also get the regular cave adaption, if left far too long under the earth, they get nauseated and puke once they come back into the sunlight. Build aboveground constructions or build a lot of skylights to negate these effects. Soldiers can carry torches instead of shields to safely travel underground.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Embark:</strong> Nothing special here. Take some pets, seeds, maybe wood or stone, pick and axe. Very vanilla DF like. There are no mod specific items you need to start as humans.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Nobles:</strong> Your noblemen are the same as the dwarven nobles, you dont need to learn anything new. Tiny name changes happened, for example the Expedition Leader is the Caravan Leader now, and the Chief Medical Dwarf is the Chief of Medicine, and the Liaison is the Guild Represantative. There is a single addition however, the Bureaucrats. They are brokers and bookkeepers and managers in one, and you can make as many as you like. Never again should a caravan leave, because your one broker is busy.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Magic:</strong> Human dont do magic much. You might have very rare migrants that found a secret in worldgen, or you hire a mage in the Adventurers Tavern. Besides that there are no supernatural powers. Your foreign warlock and succubus traders might have a few spells for you though. </p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Tech:</strong> The epitome of your technology are blackpowder weapons. Pistols, Muskets, Hand-Cannons and Cannons. Apart from that you also have access to gnomish gadget to buy from their traders. Dwarves sell you golems, turrets and landmines if you ask nicely, while adding a lot of gold to your smile.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Caste System:</strong> Humans have 30 castes. Sounds a lot, but is very simple: 2 castes for male and female peasants. 24 castes for male and female guildmembers. 4 castes for special adventurers you can hire, the Warrior, the Thief, the Barbarian and the Mage.</p>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Important stuff:</strong> Trade. Open Quarry. Money. If you keep this as a guideline, your human town should flourish. You need caravans from other civs, you get a merchants guild and call special traders. You cant go underground too much, so mine layer by layer, keeping your miners in the open. And sell all the unnecessary goods, print all your copper, silver and gold to coins and rent out as many workshops as you can. </p>
                        <p align="left">Just keep in mind that vanilla DF has <strong>one</strong> invader race, Goblins. MasterworkDF has <strong>sixteen</strong>. This means up a lot more !FUN!,snatcher, thieves, sieges and ambushes. Again, these are optional. You can even add another <strong>fifteen </strong>fortress defence races to it.                        </p>
