      <td width="798"><h1>Workshops</h1>
        <p>The hermit has a large selection of very small workbenches and workshops to outfit his cottage. Most of them offer abilities you already know from other races and will help you to survive.</p>
		        <p><strong>Craftsman Shop</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> There are several new additions to the craftsman, most important the shovel. A breakable shovel from wood or bone allows you to mine for a bit. This means you can embark without a pick.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Rock)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can make rock weapons and rock-tip arrows.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Gem)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can make gem arrows, statues and spikes, as well as split large gems into 3 smaller ones.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Wood)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong>Polish smooth wood into fairwood using oil, and cut farmed saplings into logs.</p>
<hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Cloth)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can make complete sets of clothing from wool, cotton, silk or rare silk. You can also unravel cloth back to thread. If you need a backpack or quiver, you can create them here from cloth and either wax or tallow.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Leather)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can upgrade leather types to stronger versions. Use oil or bone for leather, and combine shells, scales and chitin. You can also make ropes from leather, and make complete sets of leather clothing.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Clay)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> Use clay, fireclay or kaolinite boulder to shape greenware items. These are fired in the clay oven to the finished product, stoneware, earthenware and porcelain. This costs a unit of fuel.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Butcher)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can butcher living rock for meat or blood. Or dissect the corpse of a megabeast for a trophy and large rewards, as well as huge stacks of meat or bars.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Fossils)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> Excavate rock takes 5 boulders and might find something interesting in them. You can also restore fossils, relics or treasures, netting you deep bronze weapons or armor, golden training weapons or golden furniture. A very rare drop are dragonscales for very good leather armor.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Bone)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> Make all sorts of bone furniture, tools and weapons.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Plant)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> You can dry blade weed, quarry bush, cave weat, longland grass and whip vine to wicker. This is used to make wicker furniture.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Poison)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> Make bitterroot poison that that paralyzes the target, or shadowleaf poison that slows it down. Both are good for defenses. You can coat weapons, ammo and trap components with them. If you managed to tame or capture venomous animals, you can milk them in the farmworkshop and use a bucket of their venom to coat items as well. </p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Workbench (Alchemy)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>- </strong> Make mineral oil, oil from tallow, pitch, pearlash, potash, saltpeter and brimstone. These things are mostly used for the pitch brazier to coat your arrows and make flaming or exploding ammo. Potash and pearlash are still used for fertilizers and glass making.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bathtub</strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>Use a barrel of water from the handpump to clean all contaminants from the hermit.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Handpump</strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>Fill buckets or barrels with water. This way you can store water in your cottage without the need for a well that amphibious creatures might have access to. The water might still freeze in winter, so take care to still keep drinks around. <strong>The handpump must be build next to water.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sundail</strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>Control time. You can set the calender speed to 1/4, 1/2, normal, 2x and 4x speed. This way you can adjust the difficulty a bit. Long summers and short winters for example, or less attacks. Or more attacks, if you are bored.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Pitch Brazier</strong></p>
<p>- You can use pitch from the alchemist workbench to make flaming arrows, or blackpowder to make exploding arrows. Best use stockpile feeding, otherwise the hermit tries to light already flaming arrows again, wasting pitch.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hermit's Journal</strong></p>
<p>- Quicksave your game. Save early, save often. You only have that one guy. You can also use quills, which are made from feathers, to write in your journal. This calms the hermit down, while he reflects on his life and removes all bad thoughts. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Training Dummy</strong></p>
<p>- Use training weapons to learn combat skills. Train shield skill with bucklers, and a leather armor to train armor skill. You can also learn to dodge imaginary blows.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Weight Set</strong></p>
<p> - Use bars to train your athlete skill, raising your physical attributes. Strength, Agility, Toughness, Kinetic Sense, Spatial Sense.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>House Shrine</strong></p>
<p>- The shrine allows your hermit to pray to his gods. You can see which god a unit has in his relations screen. Pray to a god worshiped by your civilization to improve your merit.  When your merit is high enough, the god may intervene on your behalf.  Every sphere will have a different effect on gameplay, so choose your idols with care.  A god of metals may increase your smelting efficiency, while a god of agriculture may increase crop yields, a god of chaos may cause your enemies to fight among themselves, and a volcano god is likely to be a lot of !!fun!!</p>
<p>If you stop praying, the power of the gods will decrease over time.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Nature Shrine</strong></p>
<p>- The Nature Shrine is your connection with the wildlife around you. You can commune with nature here to find out how well you've been treating your animals and the wildlife around you, commune with wild animals in an attempt to tame them, and release animals into the wild in order to improve your relationship with nature. Reactions here will occasionally produce Druidic Tokens, which can be used to call animals from a greater distance.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Adv. Animal Training</strong></p>
<p align="left">- This is where you'll be able to train animals to do all kinds of things: follow a worker, form a cluster, or train animals for hunting and war - even those that are not normally trainable. Your success will be dependant on a number of factors, most importantly the skill of the trainer and the value of the animal, but the natural tendencies of the animal, the general training level, and many other aspects also go into the formula. A skilled trainer will be able to command even the strongest animals. Take one with you.</p>
<p align="left">You can also train animals in combat skills here. Doing so will require a trainer that has experience in unarmed combat. They will be able to train animals up to their own skill level.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Excavation Site</strong></p>
<p align="left">- Your hermit has a strong connection to the world around him and can sense what kind of rock might be hidden in an area. Just build the free excavation site and try to get a feel for the rock around you. This should help you find out where to dig.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Magic Altar </strong></p>
<p align="left">- After 3 years alone in the wilderness, your hermit will find a strange talisman. It will unlock one of three magic abilities. He can use it to either become a Conjurer, a Necromancer or a Mage. For this you need to bring the talisman to the magic altar. </p>
<p align="left">Conjurers can summon succubus pets from raw materials and souls. Nahashes, Orthi, Devilkin and more. </p>
<p align="left">Necromancers do not age and are friendly to undeads, great for evil regions. They raise any dead around them, and can build black monoliths, which also raise dead. They can turn souls into soul wisps, which act like suicide units that paralyze invaders.</p>
<p align="left">Mages automatically learn a free ranged attack, the magic missile. They can learn one spell of each element. Wind Gust blinds the enemy, Icicle adds a second ranged attack, Petrify takes out one invader instantly and Incinerate kills the unit, but might destroy its equipment and/or start fires.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>You can only learn one of these spells, and only the Hermit himself can do so.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Finishing Forge</strong></p>
<p>- Allows to smelt and forge tin, copper and bronze without the need for fuel. This means you have very cheap and early access to these materials. You can create weapons, armors, ammo and trapcomps here.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Crucible</strong></p>
<p>- Needs iron bars to be build, and allows production of steel, as well as other high-end metals like mithril and titanium. Can also remove rust from iron or steel.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Metallurgist</strong></p>
<p>- Needs a steel anvil to be build. The last of your new metalworks, this furnace makes any alloy in the game, or smelts down any alloy back into its base metals.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Illumination</strong></p>
<p>- Humans have 3 buildings that generate light with Rendermax: Candelabras, Braziers and Fireplaces. Same setup as dwarves use. You need the fitting illumination buildmat from your craftsman, or a statue or a large gem to build these.</p>
        <hr />
<p><strong>Decoration</strong></p>
<p>- Decorations come in 6 different workshops. The loo, which can also clean containers. The display stand, which protects your artifacts from theft, and three 1-tile workshops that can transform into different decorations. Plants, Items and Carpets. These are free and you can build as many as you like.</p>
<div align="center" id="spoiler1" style="display:none">
          <h1>lump Helmet Men</h1>
          <p align="center"><img src="screenshots/phms.png" alt="" width="755" height="63" /></p>
          <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- PHM can have between 1-10 children at a time, averaging 5 per female.  If you're not careful, they may attain the majority so fast that you won't be able to bring down their numbers quickly enough.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM will do a headcount of all non-PHM creatures in the immediate area.  If they realize that they are the majority, they will rebel.  It takes them about 1-2 weeks to figure out that they are the majority.  This has no visible effect at first.</p>
          <p><br />
            - A rebellious phase lasts for 1 week.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will be intimidated by nearby creatures.  They will usually not attack unless they outnumber their opponents.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM will not be intimidated by unconscious or sleeping creatures.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebelling PHM can sometimes drain blood from sleeping creatures like vampires.  This effect lasts for half a year after the rebellion actually starts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM cannot tell one species from another, but they can tell if the creature had been in a fight within the last year and did not run away.  Creatures who fight can intimidate up to 5 PHM at once, so they will usually not be attacked unless they are greatly outnumbered.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Once a group of PHM decide to attack, they do so by going berserk.  Nearby creatures may be attacked even if they were not the actual target.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Sometimes rebelling PHM will attack each other.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM living for a long time underground have a small chance of inflicting necrosis on themselves.  This will generate miasma, causing bad thoughts.</p>
          <p><br />
            - PHM can pick locks - forbidding doors will not control them.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Rebellious PHM cannot be contained reliably by a far-off pasture, because they have a small chance of randomly going berserk.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Trying to contain PHM behind walls to prevent gang attacks is a risky strategy - if they don't see any non-PHM creature for a while, they will rebel entirely and may rush the door the moment it is opened.</p>
          <p><br />
            - Soldiers will not obey direct orders to kill a rebellious PHM that is now docile.  However, they may choose to attack one on their own if it had been seen killing someone (the ones with names are the ones that made a kill).</p>
          <p><br />
            - Killing rebellious PHM has a chance of starting a loyalty cascade.</p>
          <p><br />
            - The best way of controlling PHM with limited dwarfpower is to pasture them nearby a major pathway, making sure that they can see all the dwarves that pass by.  Large numbers of tame animals can also prevent PHM from rebelling.  Separating them into small groups can help prevent attacks during a rebellion, as can the presence of guards that have been in combat.  Or you could go the simplest method: just eat them!</p>
