      <p align="left">Dwarves have access to several new metals and leathers that are pretty unique. Master metalsmiths and forgers, they can work adamantine and make clothing from gold, silver or mithril strands. </p>
      <p align="left">Moonsilver is blessed silver from the Oracle of Armok. It requires magma to be made. It does extreme damage against all things evil.</p>
      <p align="left">Shadesilver is blessed silver from the Oracle of Armok. It requires magma to be made. It does extreme damage against all things good.</p>
      <p align="left">Volcanic is made in the volcanic foundry. Its better than steel and does extra damage against frost giants, but is very expensive and requires magma.</p>
    <p align="left">Bifrost is half as good as adamantine, which makes it way better than steel. It can only be gained by killing frost giant invaders.</p>
    <p align="left">Dragonscales are steel-grade and temperature immune, you can only get them by killing dragons, or by luck, if your archeologist finds them.</p>
    <p align="left">Netherbark is steel-grade and eternally cold leather, made from nethercap, a tree that grows in the third cavern. You need a herblists lab for process these. </p></td>
