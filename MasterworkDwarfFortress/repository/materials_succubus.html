<h2>Available metals</h2>
The
succubi
unfortunatly did not develop metallurgy as well as other races and are
outclassed by dwarves. You will be unable to make steel. It is a good
idea to sort the spoils from sieges
and melt down steel and mithril items you will find, with perhaps the
exception of breastplates that you can wear on top of corsets. You can
also obtain rusty steel or iron and clean it at the metallurgist's
forge.<br /><h2>
Ironbone and bloodsteel</h2>
Building an alchemist's cauldron will allow the production of ironbone
using ash and bones. It is then possible to transmute the ironbone into
bloodsteel using blood.<br /><br />Blood can be obtained at the kitchen or slaughterhouse.<br />
<h2>Stygian bronze</h2>
Stygian Bronze is made at the metallurgist's forge using bronze and flux stone. In
addition to yielding even more metal per reaction (2 bars for 1
unit of bronze), stygian bronze in unnaturally lightweight. This metal
is good
for armor, providing protection without hurting speed and is okay for
cutting weapons. It is bad for blunt weapons and non bladed whips.
<br />
<br />
If you are running short of flux stone, you can grind bone at the
Bonemill as a replacement.<br />
<h2>Basiliskine</h2>
Basiliskine is, like stygian bronze, a lightweight metal suited for
cutting weapons and armors. Its resistance is at the same level as
steel, making it your best choice of protection without sacrificing
mobility. <br />
<br />
It is obtained by shearing lesser basilisk (or their larger
cousins) to obtain a horn that can be treated at the smelter.
Lesser basilisks can be obtained at the Summoning Circle using a bar of
lead and a flux material.<br />
<h2>Leather</h2>
Having
leather or their equivalent&nbsp;will allow you to further protect
your
succubi. Leather armor can be worn over corsets and chain mail can be
replaced by bodysuits.<br />
<h2>Mining hazards</h2>
Warpstone, usually
fatal to those who mine it, is beneficial to
Succubi. Your miners get positive effects from mining both weak and
unstable warpstone. Anthracite however remain hazardous to mine, unless
you capture and convert dwarves. Devils are immune to black lung.<br />
<h2>Glass mass production</h2>
After
discovering magma, or spawning some at the magma well, you will unlock
the floating glass furnace. This workshop will take raw glass to
produce blocks and windows in great quantities. </div>
