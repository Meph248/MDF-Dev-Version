                                <div align="center">
                                <em> </h1>
                                <p align="left">Kobolds. Small, dog-like humanoid with long drooping ears. Your race. </p>
                                <p align="left">Kobolds are indeed small, only 1/3 the size of a dwarf. This means that all the items looted from your invaders will most likely not benefit you much. It also means that your kobolds are not the greatest of melee fighters. Instead you have to rely on superior numbers (kekeke), ranged weapons and traps.</p>
                                <p align="left">The playstyle differs a lot from dwarves: Kobolds dont need alcohol. Kobolds cant dig stone. They can only dig soil. The biggest kobold industries are animal farming, woodstalks and clay.</p>
                                <p align="left">Bigger races generally pay no heed to you, unless you have something worth raiding. Only other kobolds will come to trade with your camp or cave. In the end, everyone else is your enemy.</p>
                                <p align="left">Kobolds are very happy and should have way fewer tantrum spirals then dwarves. And they have kids. Lots of kids. 1-5 children are born at a time and are fully grown one your later. This means its not important if 1, 2 or 20 die at a time, but it also means that you have a harder time keeping everyone well fed.</p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Even more important:</strong> Kobolds are bonecarn, they need to eat meat. This means you can no longer support yourself by farming. You have to hunt, fish or breed animals.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="2" id="22">Nobles</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Kobolds have nobles too. Sort of. Your village chief/head kobold/tribe leader. These are your expedition leader/mayor/king. Traders and hoardcounters take the place of broker and bookkeeper. Warband marshal and leader are the kobold versions of militia commanders and captians. The shaman organizes religion and manager screen, and the witch doctor tends to your wounded. </p>
                                <p align="left">And finally, your lasher. He is judge, jury and executioner using his trusty whip.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="4" id="42">Food and Drink</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Like mentioned, kobolds dont need alcohol, but do need meat. Here a bit more info:</p>
                                <p align="left">Drinking dirty water from a pond or river is bad. If you pump it into a reservior or use a well, it's good. Kobolds will also drink alcohol, which can give them good thoughts if they like the type, but they get negative effects from it. Juices and tea from the juice bar are much prefered.</p>
                                <p align="left">Food gets a bit more complicated. Even if your foodstock claims to have 500 units of food... if these are plants, your kobolds will starve. You can kill invaders or animals, fish, butcher lifestock or cook vermin remains. You can even use animal traps to catch live vermin to cook those, which gives more meat. </p>
                                <p align="left">The fishpond and jack rats are perfect to farm meat.</p>
                                <p align="left">If you use the kitchen to make prepared meals, meals need at least one meat-ingredient. Plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet is a lavish meal no one will eat.  plump helmet + plump helmet + plump helmet + meat is perfectly fine. Keep this in mind if you dont want to starve.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="5" id="52">Castes</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">There are twelve castes in Kobold Camp. Each kobold is member of a caste. They are born under specific star signs and get two abilities. </p>
                                <p align="left">You also have two magical castes, the Wiches/Witchers and the Druids. These forsake their sign-bonus for a career in magic. Any spirit-animal and sign-aimed reaction, like the spiritwalking in the sweatlodge, are inaccessable for them.</p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Turtle (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Turtle are tough, and tend to  favor shell and bone crafts.  When they must fight they favor a shield.  Like all Water Sign kobolds, they are natural swimmers. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Eel (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Eel are agile, and tend to be fine fishers.  Like all Water Sign kobolds they are natural swimmers. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Dartfrog (Water)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Dartfrog are intrigued by poisons, toxins, and all other forms of brewing.  Like all Water Sign kobolds they are natural swimmers. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Rat (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Rat are resitant to disease, and tend to favor working with animals.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Salamander (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Salamander are resitant to fire, and are entranced by the heat of a forge.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Coyote (Fire)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Coyote are creative free spirits and tend to excel at craftswork.  Like all Fire Sign Kobolds they move a bit more quickly than others. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Kestrel (Air) </strong>Kobolds born under the Sign of the Kestrel are natural hunters and bowyers.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Owl (Air)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Owl are wise and tend to make good students and teachers alike.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Bluebird (Air)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Bluebird are at peace with wild creatures and tend to find work in medicine.  Like all Air Sign kobolds, they are adept at stealth and cannot be ensnared in webs. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Viper (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Viper are not shy about close combat with knife nor fang.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Lizard (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Lizard have great powers of recuperation.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it. </p>
                                <p align="left"><strong>Badger (Earth)</strong> Kobolds born under the Sign of the Badger are strong and ferocious, and tend to find work as butchers.  Like all Earth Sign kobolds, they begin to thrive upon combat once they get a taste of it.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="6" id="62">Clay</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Clay is not often used by dwarves. Kobolds on the other hand use it as their main source of rock. Due to unexplainable quantum mechanics, one tile of clay can be the source of unlimited clay boulders. You can make walls and huts, workshops and furnaces, even furniture and tools from clay. </p>
                                <p align="left">Constructions, like walls and floors, can be made from normal, sundried clay, while furniture and items must be burned in the clay oven first.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="8" id="722">Poisons</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Poisons play a big role in kobold society. The earliest squads should use blowguns with poisoned darts, and later tech allows you to poison traps and weapons as well. Being naturally bad melee fighters, be sure to rely on this little extra in fights.</p>
                                <p align="left">You need kobold bulb for the first, and plants+oil+tallow for the second. Later in the game you can mix much more powerful poisons in a workshop tech stolen from the deep drow.</p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="9" id="7222">Alcohol</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Unlike dwarves, kobolds cannot drink all day without feeling an ill effect. Alcoholic drinks give a reduction to speed, possible dizziness and nausea, but also make your bold fearless. This effect is temporary, but you should better stick to juices, tea or water for your camp.</p>
                                <p align="left">This means alcohol as drink source should be a last resort only. </p>
                                <hr align="left" />
                                <h1 align="left"><a name="10" id="72222">Materials</a></h1>
                                <p align="left">Usually players build most things of stone and metal. Both materials are rare when playing Kobold Camp. Your primary buildmats are leather and wood. Dyes, bones and skulls are also quite important, but a good tanning industry is a must for a successful camp.</p>
                                <p align="left">Warpaints, tattoos, scrolls and ceremonial totems all use dyes to be made, and your early trap-parts are based on wood and bones.</p>
                                <p align="left">Gems should be preserved for the more ritualistic reactions of the magic tech tree.</p>

                        <h1 align="left"><a name="1a" id="1a">Witchers</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">Witchers are the ranged mages your kobolds can employ. They are good supporters and have 2 initial abilities. To use mages correctly, you dont have to do anything, really. You can just assign them normal military duty and they will use their abilities as soon as they see a valid target.</p>
                        <p align="left">Witches are female and can throw shadow-webs and entangle a single unit in roots.</p>
                        <p align="left">Witchers are male and can curse enemies with sickness and slow them down.</p>
                        <p align="left">Both castes can learn an additional 15 spells each. A hide spell, a haste spell and a blood-spike ranged attack you can pay for yourself. The other 12 are learned from mojos you have to steal from orcs or frost giants.</p>
                        <p align="left">To become a witcher you need a witchers hut.                        </p>
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="2a" id="2a">Druids</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">Druids are the kobold melee mages. Once they reach the enemy they transform into a giant spirit bear. Twice the size of a normal grizzly and covered in a protective, steel-grade aura, they are good fighters. They will stay in bear-form for 1 week, followed by 1 week of dizziness and slowness. Once they are back to normal, they can transform again. This means you can employ them in battle about every 2 weeks.</p>
                        <p align="left">Keep in mind that they will drop all equipment when they transform, so you dont have to assign good gear to them. Probably some armorparts and a shield, but thats it.</p>
                        <p align="left">To become a druid you need a druids hut and half a year of time for meditation. Meditating kobolds dont do any work and are rather easy targets, so make sure to guard them well.</p>
                        <hr align="left" />
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="3a" id="3a">Warpaint</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">You can paint armors in the warpainters studio.</p>
                        <p align="left">Kobold warpaint has special effects on the wearer and can cover any leather-made armor. You can chose between seven different abilities, and you can stack different ones on the same armor, but not the same effect twice. This means &quot;10% speed + no stun&quot; is ok, but &quot;10% speed + 10% speed&quot; wont work.</p>
                        <p align="left">Dyes are produced, like always, from plants. The only exception is carmine dye, which is made from the hive-able cochineal insect.</p>
                        <hr align="left" />
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="4a" id="4a">Tattoo</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">You can tattoo a kobold with henna in a tattoo parlor. You first need to steal the building plans from the humans.</p>
                        <p align="left">Being tattooed with a tribal henna tattoo is a great honor for a kobold. The boost in confidence and the frightening look of them helps them work and fight better. Each tattooed kobold will gain a 30% bonus on strength, toughness, endurance and recuperation.</p>
                        <p align="left">Each kobold will show '(tattooed)' behind his name.</p>
                        <p align="left">Henna tattoos fade after a while, the effect lasts for about 1 year.<br />

                        <p align="left">Hexes are magical objects producted in the hexers hut. They require a stack of bones to be thrown in prophesy, and the results might be a magical hex. Then again, it might only be a pile of bones. You should get about one hex every second try.</p>
                        <p align="left">You can enchant weapon with sickness, slow and madness effects, and grow your keas and badgers to giant monsters, or give them the gift of intelligence with a hex. You can even stack the hexes on a weapon, or combine them with a poison of your choice.</p>
                        <p align="left">Hexes are officially tools and are stockpiled as such.</p>
                        <hr align="left" />
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="6a" id="6a">Curses</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">Curses are spoken in the voodoo totem. Its building plans must be stolen from the warlocks first, and all curses need unholy relics either stolen, or taken from the dead cold hands of warlocks.</p>
                        <p align="left">You have three kinds of curses. The first one raises most to all of the dead on the map as undead zombies that attack the living. Depending on your point of view, that can be good or bad.</p>
                        <p align="left">You can also curse an entire race. Every member of that race will suddenly feel his blood boil, and he will sweat liquid magma, burning himself alive and setting the world on fire. One singular curse can wipe out an entire army. Keep in mind the magma causes friendly fire as well, will destroy their gear, and anything of yours that is nearby.</p>
                        <p align="left">The last curse is a self-destruct option, you will curse your own tribe with it.</p>
                        <p align="left">You will need 10 unholy relics for each curse. They count as tools and stockpiled as such.</p>
                        <p align="left">Using curses will have negative effects on your kobolds, the morale will sink and all negative thoughts will be intensified. While this is normally no problem for one or two curses, you will notice increasing tantruming and madness if you curse too many enemies.</p>
                        <hr align="left" />
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="7a" id="7a">Ceremonies/Dances</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">Ceremonies and Raindances are the positive version of curses. Using simple ingredients and a gemstone, you can alter the weather and help nature to grow back natural resources like grass and trees.</p>
                        <p align="left">To gain access to the ceremonial grounds, you first need to steal the building plan from the orcs.</p>
                        <hr align="left" />
                        <h1 align="left"><a name="8a" id="8a">Spiritwalking</a></h1>
                        <p align="left">All kobolds are born under an animal sign. They can access the powers of these guardians, by taking on abilities of their sign for example. For more information on this, please see &quot;General Changes:Castes&quot;.</p>
                        <p align="left">Kobolds that have a sign can sometimes spiritwalk them their animals as guide. Currently this is possible by meditating in the sweatlodge and will result in a fully healed kobold. Even lost limbs, broken spines and nerve damage can be healed in such a way.</p>
                      <p align="left">Because witchers and druids abandoned their birth signs and are drawn to different sorts of magic, they cannot spiritwalk.</p></td>
