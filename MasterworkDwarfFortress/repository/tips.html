          <h1 align="center"><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Vanilla Tips and Tricks</a></h1>
          <p align="center">All these tricks are collected from the forum and are for vanilla DF. They also work in the mod, but there are no mod spe<em>cific entries here.</em>          </p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>1. Mass Dumping</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By pressing d-b-d you can select every item on the   screen for dumping. In the same menu you will find the shortcuts for Unumping   (d-b-D), Forbidding (d-b-f) and Reclaiming (d-b-c)  <br />
            <br />
            <strong>2. Quantum   Stockpiles</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>In stockpile, every item requires one square. By   making an open-space square and marking it as a garbage dump, you can throw   unlimited items into it. Everything will staple in a place one Z-level below.   Just dig an access tunnel and unforbid the items to use them. Note that no   actual stockpiles are necessary. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>3. Atom smashing</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Items under a closing drawbridge will be removed   from the game. An atom-smashing device would use a Quantum Stockpile and a   raised drawbrigde that closes upon the Quantum stockpile, destroying everything   inside. Used to remove clutter and help FPS. Can also be used as an exploit (?)   to kill creatures. Creatures of immense size will instead destroy the bridge,   when lowered. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>4. Watchtowers</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Ambusher will move invisible over the map, till   they encounter a living being. By placing pets on chains on chokepoints you can   detect them safely. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>5. Building destroyer traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>A creature with the building destroyer will path to   the nearest building. Building a little maze with a statue inside, protected by   cage/weapon-traps will neutralize the threat. Works most awesomely with a   Support holding a 3x3 floor one Z-level above. Support gets destroyed and the   3x3 square will fall down, killing everything with a cave-in. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><br />
            <strong>6. Trapping trap-avoid   creatures</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>It is possible to trap creatures that avoid traps   by placing a web over the trap. Getting a gaint-cave-spider to shoot at your   traps does somehow require some preperation. Easier when done with tamed   spiders. Cave-In dust will also push creatures into traps. The stun-effect will   disable the trapavoid. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>7. Saving dwarves that are outside during   invasion</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Build small rooms in the countryside, 3x3, with a   floorhatch and some food/drinks inside. When a force of darkness arrives, send   your dwarves into those by adding them to burrows you made in these bunkers.   Afterwards lock the floorhatch. Miner can rescue themselves, by digging a 1x1   channel, and then again a 1x1 channel in the same square. No direct pathing and   no direct line of sight will keep the invaders away. Afterwards dig exit   stairs. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>8. Wells can be built with many Z-levels   between them and water.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>A 50 Z-level drop to a cavern lake is absolutely   possible. But note that the bucket has a longer way to travel, making them less   effective. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>9. Water can be drained by engraving   fortifactions on the map edge.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>All water will now flow through and off the   map. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>10. Picks use the mining skill even in   combat.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Assign legendary miners into your army, or draft   them as a back up militia. Enables fast training for your soldiers as well, just   designate a huge area for digging, enable mining labor and give all your   soldiers picks. Legendary weapon skill in no time. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong> 11.Ballistas are very inaccurate.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By building a 3-tile wide corridor and a 5-tile   wide room in the end you can build 3 ballistas that cover one corridor. Build   the first ballista to the left, the second behind it one tile to the right, the   third behind it another tile to the right. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>12. Dwarves build walls from the wrong   side.</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Default is to build from the left or top to build a   construction. To avoid getting your dwarves stuck just build a wall in the   square you want your dwarves to avoid, and suspend it before it is finished.   Then finish the construction you wanted, and cancel the suspended wall. Dwarves   will always choose to stand on a normal square then a square designated to be   used in any way.  <br />
          </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>13. Designation selection</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>When you designate, for example, every tree to be   cut the woodcutters will start top-left, no matter how far away this is. To   avoid long distances for your workers and haulers designate a smaller block   nearby, afterwards expand slowly. That is also safer, since your dwarves will no   longer be scattered all over the map. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>14. Cavern avoidance</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you want to avoid caverns and get straight to   the magma, dig your stairs in a straight line in one of the corners of the map.   That reduces the chance to hit a cavern significantly. </em>You can also <em>start building a farmplot, but before you press enter just take the farmplot and scroll down. The X that indicate if floor is soil or rock will turn green once they are above cavern soil. This is an exploit that has been named &quot;dwarven radar&quot; and can be found in the bay12forum, in case you want more info and screenshots.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>15. Designation over multiple   Z-levels<br />
          </strong>By using your mouse to do a designation, holding the mouse   button down and then scrolling Z-levels you will apply the designation in every   Z-level. Helps a lof for building long Up-down-staircases and pumpstacks. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>16. Free marksman equipment</strong> <br />
            If   the ambusher skill is the highest skill a dwarf has at embark, he will embark   with a leather armor, a crossbow and 25 random material bolts. Just disable the   hunter labor and you have a fully geared back-up marksdwarf from the very start. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong> 17. Make your woodcutter your animal   trainer.</strong> <br />
            Woodcutters are the most exposed and endangered dwarves   you have. Adding war-dogs will protect them, but the bads thougt of dead pets   might cause tantruming. But unassigned war-animals will always follor their   trainer. This way you can protect your woodcutters and keep your wardogs free   for other assignments if needed. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>18. The trade depot has an alternate   setting for finding tradegoods. </strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>You can sort by distance (default) or by value, or   even find by name. Just look at the hotkeys in the bottom of the tradescreen.   This saves a lot of time. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>19. Trade ways</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>By pressing D you can see if a 3-tile path is   aviable from the map edge to your trade depot. Although wagons do not work in   the current version (31.25) it is still possible to control the caravan spawn   point. If you have only one path aviable from depot to edge, the caravan will   always spawn there. Makes it easy to protect them from ambushes/invaders, </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>20. Dodge traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Almost an exploit, you could build weapon traps on   a 1-tile wide floor, with open space on both sides. Imagine a long, narrow   bridge made of floor-tiles, covered in weapon traps. Creatures that step on the   traps will try to dodge and fall into the pit next to them. This is extremly   effective. Most useful when a natural pit is aviable, like a river. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>21. Wildlife traps</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Free roaming animals will almost never get into one   of your cagetraps. To increase the change build a gaint X on the map made of   walls. Leave the center tile free, so animals can path through it. Then build   cagetraps in the center. The larger the X, the higher the change for a catch.   Will also work for ambushers and invaders. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>                                       <strong> 22.   Metal Furniture</strong>                                          </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Metal furniture can be built by a mason out of the   metal. No need for a forge and coal. Uses the mason skill. You have to enable   the material first in the Stone screen. Press z and go to Stones at the top. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>23. Deadly Ice</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you have frozen rivers or lakes and want to   avoid drowning dwarves in spring, go to the traffic designations, d-o-r, and   mark all ice as restricted. Dwarves will now walk around it. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>24. Tree growth</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you want to prevent trees from growing in your   soil and clay corridors, create a stockpile with no goods enabled over them.   Plants will no longer grow there, but take care: As soon as you remove the   stockpile all trees that did grow invisible underneath it will pop up   instantly. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><br />
            <strong>25. Spoiler Material – Read with   care</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>If you ever happen to have a blue metallic thread   in your possesion, take care to limit access to it. Doctors will use it to   suture patients.If you ever happen to find a blue masterpiece weapon on your   map, construct a floor in front of it. The weapon can be deconstructed like a   building and claimed for your army. But beware, if you build the floor, you will   rob yourself of fun. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>Honorable mention: Danger   Room<br />
          </strong>A danger room is a small 3x3 – 5x5 room full of upright spike   traps, filled with wooden training spears. Linked to a lever that has: Pull the   lever (R) activated this causes everyone stationed in the room to learn combat   skills very fast. Be careful not to station mothers with babys or petowners in   the room. A locked door helps keeping people in longer. Quite a few people   regard this as an exploit, since your dwarfs become overpowered. </em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>PS: I buffed the dangerroom in the mod, so use it with care. It might be more dangerous then you remember.</em>        </p>
        <p align="center"><em>PROTIP: Read the Wiki at <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" >http://df.magmawiki.com/</a></em></p></div>

</p>
<div id="hidden2" style="display:none;">
  <h1 align="center"><a name="HUMAN" id="HUMAN">Dwarf Tips and Trick</a><em>s</em></h1>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>1. Custom Catapult Ammo</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Catapults and Ballistas are really bad in vanilla DF. But the mod includes the siege-engine-control plugin. You have to look at a siege engine using 'q' and then press Alt-A to start it. You can now load custom ammo into catapults. That can be anything, boulders, blocks, weapons, furniture, corpses... </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>The best ammo is: loaded cages. Throw cages full of wild animals. Throw landmines this way. Even throw golems. The thrown creatures take no damage, because the flying objects is the cage. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Magma Landmines</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While very ineffective at spawning large quantities of magma, the liquid spawner can be used another way. Once you use the &quot;blood of armok&quot; gem to create magma, just leave it be. The liquid will remain safely inside the workshop till it is deconstructed. So all you have to do is dot the landscape with spawn locations, spawn magma in them and wait for a silly creature with building-destroyer tag. It will raze the workshop and spawn magma right next to it.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>3. Web + Fire Combo</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Many weapons and creatures can throw webs. Many weapons and creatures can shoot fire. Normally, both are a good weapon, but creatures cant be harmed by webs alone and most invaders dont take much damage from fire. This is because they only bring metal armor, but dont wear flameable clothing. They also have shields to block the firejet.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>But if they are webbed, they cant block the fire. And webs themselves can burn, settings things around them on fire. To make it short: Station a web and a flame turret together, or use a dwarf with a net-thrower and a fire-breathing warpet. That combo is quite deadly.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>4. Correct landmine usage</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Landmines are quite easy to counter by the enemy, so here three simple ways to use them well:</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>A: Put them in a maze next to the corners. This way  ranged units cant kill</em> them from afar.</p>
        <p align="center">B: Put them in build cages that are linked to levers. Wait for invaders, release landmine.</p>
        <p align="center">C: Build a murder hole. Wait for invaders, lock them in a room, then one z-lvl above have a p<em>asture of landmines and a hatch. Then simply dump the landmines down the hatch, right on the heads of the invaders.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>5. Item/Material Combos</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>A big  part of the mod  </em>are the new workshops. These can sometimes be exploited<em> and do something they were not designed for. For example you can &quot;collect clay&quot; for boulders, &quot;make blocks&quot; from them, then compress the blocks in the crucible to slade. Free slade for everyone. Another example is slag. Slag bars, as useless as they are, can still be used for constructions, they make cheap metal walls and floors.</em> No need for a slagp<em>it this way.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><br />
          <strong>6. Absolute Overkill</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><em>You can improve weapons in the weaponry. You can coat weapons with poison in the toxicologist. You can engrave weapons with runes in the rune weaponry.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>You can also do all three to one weapon. A masterwork legendary mithril great axe, coated with 10 different runes and 20 different poisons... will probably insta-kill everything it hits. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>7. Early poisons</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While on the topic of poisons: They can be bought directly at embark under the &quot;extracts&quot; section. So take one barrel of nasty poison, like cave spider venom or coral snake venom and your early military will have no problems. Give one dwarf 5 points in dodging and in a weapon skill, take one cheap weapon and one barrel of poison. Thats it, your first soldier will now almost insta-kill all normal creatures.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>8. Starting Number of Dwarves</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Just a friendly reminder: If you type &quot;startdwarf X&quot; into dfhack before you embark, your starting 7 will be your starting X. 200 dwarves at embark? No problem. Just keep in mind that they need food and drink. I myself embarked very successfully with 42 kobolds once, so higher numbers are possible if managed correctly.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>9. Smoke Effects give extra experience</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>If you want to cheat a little, tiny bit, you can enable to Smoke Effects. Labled purely ornamental, the button adds smoke, sawdust, sparks and similar effects to workshops. But since they are an extra item that is created, they also generate extra XP for the worker. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>10. Crates at Embark</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>To buy otherwise inaccessable custom tradegoods, check your &quot;misc&quot; section at embark. You might have to ramp up your embark points in the worldgen, but you will find all crates in there. Books at embark? Steel Armorsets? Rare Trade-only Plants?</em> No problem. You will still need the Storage Warehouse to unpack them.</p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong> 11. Protecting Miners, Hunters and Woodcutters</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Since these three professions have a conflict of uniforms, you cant assign them military armor, while they mine, hunt and fell trees. But you can make civilian clothing from metal strands, or from the high-tier animal materials like rigid chitin/scale/shell or lamellar leather. These are at least irongrade or higher and will keep your civilians safe.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>12. DFHACK</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Dfhack is not just for cheating, it is a powerful tool for the player. Read the readme. Memorize the hotkeys. Have a look at the custom plugins that are included. Open dfhack.init and read through it. Use it. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can designate entire veins for mining, load custom ammo into siege engines, you have a mini-therapist included in the game, the dwarf monitor that shows how efficient the dwarves work, the workflow plugin which is an improved manager, autobutcher for farming, searches for many sub-menus... renaming of workshops or even pets and more.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>So yeah, PROTIP: Learn to use dfhack efficiently.<br />
        </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>13. Battle-Picks, Great Axes and Javelin Throwers</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Miners, Woodcutters and Hunters dont have to use the normal picks, woodchoppers and crossbows. You can give them finest military-grade gear, which will make them a lot better suited for combat. Mind the battle-picks dont mine faster and great axes dont cut trees faster, but otherwise they are a huge improvement.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>14. Invaders Infighting</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Different races follow different ethics. This means that the Frost Giant siege, that is bothering you, can be cleaned</em> by getting even more enemies <em>on the map. Warlocks are especially good for this, since their spells are AoE. So maybe, just maybe, it is a good idea to spawn more invaders or megabeasts using the embassy, if you are locked in your fortress by superior invaders. It might not work, because you might end up with two invading armies that are best buddies, but you can always try.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>15. Even more Infighting<br />
        </strong>There are many options to make enemies fight themselves. Voodoo and Nether poisons are one, raising the dead with the bonerattle is another. To deliver the poison it is best to coat ammo, otherwise your dwarves will get caught in the fray. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can also reroute your entry through the caverns, forcing invaders to battle with cavern monsters. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>16. Sacrificing Possessed Dwarves</strong> <br />
        If you play with &quot;secret fun stuff&quot; on, you will now and then stumble upon a suspicious dwarf. While most of them  can be cured</em>, it is far easier to simpl<em>y tell them to go to the Altar or Temple of Armok and sacrifice themselves to the Blood God. This will not only net you a nice item as a reward, but also gets rid of the possible danger they pose. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>You can also use them for golemification, pacifiyng them in the process.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong> 17. Exploiting autosyndrome</strong> <br />
          Many reaction</em> use a specific dfhack script to work. Boiling <em>rocks most of all. Be it guilds or military groups, golem forge or animal armoring, you can often trick it into targetting multiple creatures. So if you want to safe some reagents, simply station 10 soldiers on the workshop, or pasture 20 dogs to be armored, or 30 changelings/sprites to become a new creature. You might be in luck and get several transformations from one go.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>18. Downright cheating with autosyndrome</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>While I dont recommend this, several people stumbled upon it, so I might as well say it: All reactions using autosyndrome, which is usually everything that affects the worker, can be done for free. Start the reaction, wait for the 'A' for active next to it, and before the dwarf finishes the reaction, cancel it. While no product is created, the script still notices that a reaction has been finished (even if it is cancelled) and it will run the script. This means you can run the reaction without using up the reagents. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Since this is cheating, not just an exploit, I can only ask you not to abuse it all too much.</em> It kills the FUN.        </p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>19. Digv vs Metalwraiths and Coaldust</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">Coal<em>dust, Metalwraiths and hidden fun stuff in inorganics, are all specific inorganics that you cannot distinguish from the surrounding rock. But dfhack can. If you see a cobaltite vein, and dig it with the digv command, then notice that a single tile is left over... thats the hidden fun stuff. </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>20. Guilds reset attributes.</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">Since joining a guild or milita<em>ry group transforms the dwarf into a new creature, you can abuse this by transforming him again and again till you find a dwarf with near perfect stats. Might cost some gold though.</em></p>
        <hr align="center" />
        <p align="center"><em><strong>Spoiler Material – Read with   care</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>Once you dig into hell, you will notice a significant difference to normal DF. You can dig slade. That makes colonizing hell a lot easier, since you can dig a safe bunker directly into the floor. Slade will also leave slade boulders, which you can use for doors and hatches, securing your position.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>A Request:</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center">If you know any more exploits, cheats or just neat little tricks you found while playing <em>the mod, please leave me a PM in the forum or post about it. I will add it into this list. :)</em></p></div>

  <h1 align="center"><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Orc Tips and Tricks</a></h1></p>
<h3>Orc Physiology</h3>

<p>Uruks are about 50/% larger than snaga -- only these larger orcs can
effectively equip a great-axe or daikatana with a shield.  Snaga usually
have the agility to be deadly with bows, but lack the strength to use blunt
weapons with poor leverage (i.e., clubs).  Try to give your orcs equipment
that matches their skills (you'll never go too far wrong with scimitars,
jagged axes, and jagged spears).</p>

<h3>Economizing on Raiding Gear</h3>

<p>The Raiders Drydock is used not only to strike back at the
'Free' Peoples and grab some loot, but also to round up
goblins, steal codexes, and may trigger sieges against your camp.
It's risky business, but scalps and souls are the only way to
unlock the more powerful buildings and technologies in Orc Fortress.</p>

<p>To support the
Drydock you'll need a source of rusty iron coins, ballista parts,
plenty of wood, and also Weapons. Exchanging bounties at the
Freelancer's guild is usually the best source of coins, but you
might also mint coins from rusty iron bars you get from Molten Pit or
Goblin trading partners. If you are short on wood but have plenty
of cloth and pulleys, consider sail-powered Xebecs instead of regular
Longboats. If you don't have junk weapons laying around,
forge weapons with the smallest materials requirement like daggers, or
save on materials by batch production at the Orcish Factory.</p>

<h3>Above Ground Forts and Aquifer Forts</h3>

<p>Don't be afraid of aquifer embarks! Orcs have lots of tools 
available to make strong mostly- and even entirely-above ground forts, 
starting with the arms and armor from the Tribal Warcrafter and 
Fletcher, and Boneyard for mechanisms. Many of the orcish places of
power, along with the drydock, <em>must</em> be built above ground.</p>

<p>Trade for cheap raw materials from the Goblins civilization if they are active. Once 
you get your drydock and Raiding crews on line, you can raid the Elves for wood, the 
Dwarves for metal, or Merchants for precious metals and captives to 
expand your purchasing options.</p>

<h3>Ranchers and Hunters</h3>

<p>Orcs can do a lot with leather, bone, and blood at the Tribal Craftsorc 
and Fletcher, so you might want to get Ranchers or Hunters industry 
going early. Embarking with some birds or ranching animals is 
usually more efficient use of points than paying for leather or quivers 
directly.</p>

<h3>Organizing Tool Stockpiles</h3>

<p>There are lots of new items in Orc Fortress, and a lot of them are 
stockpiled as Tools. Use Materials setting in your stockpile to 
control which type of tools goes where. For example: elven 
enchanted toolkits should always be mithril, while warrior society 
codexes should always be steel.</p>

<h3>Harder Smithing setting &amp; Artisan Craft Efficiency</h3>

<p>Orc Fortress is balanced assuming the "Harder Smithing" setting is on.
Many of the custom reactions will cost a similar amout of material to
Harder Smithing, and some will have efficiency savings like the batch
processes at the factory.  If you play Normal Smithing, the tradeoffs
will be different, and in many cases you might be just better off with
more ordinary forges.</p>

<h3>Harder Farming setting &amp; Captives</h3>

<p>Your Raiders will sometimes bring back a "Dwarven (etc.) 
Captive". In an embark with shortages of materials like wood, 
stone, or cloth, the Labor Cell workshop can be invaluable, but careful 
because the laborers will go through food or drink pretty fast. If 
you bring them a big stack of food, they'll produce more output, but 
they'll still eat it all. If you play Harder Farming you'll 
need a large food production capacity to use captive labor with any 
regularity. You can also ransom 
the captives at the Shadowbroker for a random  large sum of coins and a 
commemorative statue, suitable for mounting in your trophy hall.</p>

<h3>Vermin Hunting Options</h3>

<p>Orcs can use cats or frill lizards for vermin hunting. You also 
may have access to drowspiders or arctic condors. Arctic 
condors are trainable for regular hunting too.</p>

<h3>Slag Pit setting vs. the Orcish Molten Pit</h3>

<p>Orc Fortress already had its own "slag" system that is 
different from the one implemented in Masterwork. When you use the 
Orcish Molten Pit to smelt batches of ore or destroy trash gear, you 
have a chance to produce low-value (but possibly useful) rusty iron, 
dolomite, malachite, or potash. If you really like slag you can 
turn on the Masterwork system too; the Orcs now have access to the 
Dwarf-style slag pit for processing "slag bars".</p>

<h3>Magma Engineering</h3>

<p>There is lots you can do with the Magma Source and you should 
experiment, but here is an idea of how to get started. * Build a 
rail line with one end near your source station and the other at the 
edge of the target: cistern, aquifer to be obsidianized, river to be dammed, etc. * 
Build a stop at both ends. the end by the cistern should auto-dump 
towards the cistern. * Create a tram route set to "push cart when 
greater than 50% full," note that using the "guide" setting can put 
workers in splash-danger. * Create a return condition "guide when empty" 
* Add a magmatanker to the route * Set magmasource to fill the tanker using manager.
Magma/water cisterns are filled by Orcs carrying the "magma filled 
bottle" item created at the Source station, and will release the fluid 
when deconstructed. You may want to rig a support cave in to do 
this remotely. Workshops seems to be able to fill it's own area plus 
about one ring around (assuming it has enough magma inside). So a 1 tile 
workshop can fill a 3x3 space, and a 3x3 shop can fill 5x5 space.</p>

<h3>Places of Power and Rare Gems</h3>

<p>Spellcrafting reactions require specific material like silver and 
gold for the druidic magic at the Stone Circle, and bloodsteel and iron 
for sorcerers magic at the Altar of Storms. You may want to 
consider the resources on hand if you are choosing one school of magic 
over the other. They also require small quantities of specific 
rare gems like emerald, sapphires, or clear diamonds. If you lack 
silver, gold, or rare gems, look to your Raiders to attack merchant 
shipping, or equip thieves at the Kobold Trackers hut.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>1.</strong></em> Embark on caves. Its 100 times more fun.</p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>2.</strong></em> Bring Jack Rats. They give birth to 3 - 5 babies each. Seriously, dont embark without a ton of animals <em>to butcher for leather.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>3.</strong></em> Trap Spiders can web your traps, <em>which capture even trap-avoid creatures. Be wary of friendly fire, your Kobolds can get webbed too.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>4.</strong></em> Kobolds dont need alcohol. Water is perfectly fine.</p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>5.</strong></em> Kobolds do need meat. They wont eat plants at all. F<em>arming is only for ingredients, not your main food source.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>6.</strong></em> Clay. One tile of clay gives unlimited b<em>oulders. You only need a kiln to issue the &quot;collect clay&quot; labor. Then make a zone:clay to start collecting. Unlimited clay boulders for everyone.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>7.</strong></em> Woodstalks are important. <em>So is the entire wood industry.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>8.</strong></em> Metal<em>, coal and gems are very, very hard to come by. Moods might get very difficult to handle.</em> Ironbone is the only metal you can create yoursel<em>f.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>9.</strong></em> <em>Kobolds are tiny. Avoid melee combat.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><em><strong>10.</strong></em> Stealing fro<em>m other civs is a high-risk, high-reward option. Many items can only be gained through thievery, like metals or gems.</em> </p>
          <p align="center"><strong>11</strong>. You can dig surpr<em>isingly deep if you dig veins and rubble using up/downstairs instead of digging. Every dug tile will show you the tile underneath it, which makes it easier to find other metal veins, gems and more rubble patches. Usually it is possible to reach the caverns this way.</em></p>
          <p align="center"><strong>12</strong>. Thin suede is your friend. Dont have enough leather for buildings? Remember that <em>you can cut each piece of leather into 3 pieces of suede. Useless as armor material, its still good enough for tents. This triples your leather amount.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><strong>13</strong><em>. </em>The <em>bite of the psychotropic toad also carries all these random syndromes. Maybe it makes sense to war-train them, for some special surprise.</em></p>
        <p align="center"><em><strong>14</strong>. </em>Using magical boosts, warpainted armor, tattoo<em>s and good metal-gear, your late-game kobolds can hold their own in melee. Just because most of the game you do hide behind ogres and shoot poisoned ammo, doesnt mean that you cant upgrade to actual close-combat once you have the ability to do so. And remember, kobolds come cheap.</em></p>

<div id="hidden5" style="display:none;">

  <h1 align="center"><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Gnome Tips and Tricks</a></h1></p>
		  <p><strong>Make sure to set up a Seismic Telegraph within the first year.</strong>  Even if you have nothing worth trading, you have to contact the homeland once in a while or they'll stop sending migrants.</p>
		  <p>Gnomes are tiny.  Don't expect to win many fights unless you have the enemy extremely outnumbered.  In general, hiding out and letting your traps or pets do the work is a better option than trying to fight enemies directly.</p>
		  <p>Using the Excavation Site on a regular basis will let you find valuable minerals, ores, and gems quickly.</p>

          <p align="center"><em><strong>Machine Safety.</strong></em></p>
		  <p>While useful for producing items, gnome machines, especially those involved in automatic manufacturing, are dangerous.  Many gnome fortresses are destroyed not through enemies or starvation, but through a chain reaction that begins with a careless gnome falling into a moving machine and getting turned into a gnome bone table.  If you're going to build a lot of machines, taking some basic precautions will serve you well.</p>
		  <p>Make sure every machine can be shut off.  This should go without saying.</p>
		  <p>Do not attempt to construct a machine connected to a moving power source.  The builder will be killed the moment the machine is completed.  This also applies to adding a machine input to an operating factory.</p>
		  <p>The moment a machine is constructed, designate its input tiles (the center tile of the main machine, as well as all machine inputs) as forbidden traffic areas.  Also designate all safe spaces adjacent to the forbidden spots as high traffic areas.  This should keep gnomes from randomly wandering into the moving parts.</p>
		  <p>Pets getting caught by machines is also a bad thing.  Keep the doors to the machine room tightly shut.  You may also want to separate your machine operators from your animal trainers, to prevent animals from following their trainers into the machine room and getting themselves killed.</p>
		  <p>Do not attempt to adjust the settings on a machine while it is running.</p>
		  <p>While gnomes can survive placing items directly into the input feed while the machine is running, you'll be taking a chance every time.  The faster the machine is running, the more dangerous it is.  Avoid this.</p>
		  <p>Altogether, your best option is to avoid entering the machine room altogether.  A much better plan is to feed items into the machine using a minecart with an auto-dumping track stop or a garbage pit positioned above the machine's input tile.  This is also faster and requires less micromanagement than feeding items into the machine directly, as several gnomes will be working at once.  You can even use an automatic cart loader to send the items back after processing, preventing the need from entering the machine area at all.</p>
          
		  <p align="center"><em><strong>Getting on Nature's Good Side.</strong></em></p>
		  <p>When it comes to recruiting animals from the wild, your chances will be greatly improved if you treat your animals well.  They are members of your community, not livestock or expendable mooks.  Don't send them against an enemy too strong for them, don't let them die of starvation, and definitely do not slaughter them for meat.</p>
		  <p>If you need meat or animal parts, get it by hunting.  Hunting animals will count against you, but as long as you only do so in moderation and take good care of your pets, you'll still come out positive.  (Note: This only applies if the animal had not been tamed.  Don't try and fool the system by releasing an animal and then killing it.)</p>
		  <p>Unnatural monsters are not included in this judgement.  Feel free to slay the horrors of the caverns to your hearts content.  Note that what is considered 'unnatural' may not be what you expect (most giant insects are considered 'natural', and carry a fairly severe penalty for killing, at that).  As a general rule, if it attacks or frightens your gnomes, it's fair game.  Stationed military gnomes will only attack unnatural creatures unless you specifically tell them otherwise.</p>
		  <p>Not all animals are equal.  Everything is multiplied by a creature's pet value, so what happens to a high-value creature is much more significant than what happens to a low-level creature.</p>
		  <p>Young animals count double when taken care of, but also count double if you let them die.</p>
		  <p>When your population gets too high and framerate becomes a problem, get rid of animals by releasing them into the wild.  Releasing adult animals is worth twice as much as keeping them.  However, young animals count more if you keep them around until they are grown.</p>
		  <p>Taking care of wild-caught animals, or releasing them, counts five times as much as animals born in captivity.  Letting them die is also five times as bad.  If your motive is to create an animal army, you might want to wait until they have children, then release the parents and raise the children for combat instead.</p>
		  <p>By far the fastest way of building up your merit is capturing wild animals, taming them, and then releasing them into the wild.  Taming a giant cavern insect and releasing it can boost your merit score by thousands in one shot - and they often come in groups.</p>
		  <p>Don't worry about it when animals steal from you.  In fact, you might want to leave gifts for them.  When wild animals leave the map carrying items, you will get merit based on the value of the stolen item.  Items stolen by unnatural or supernatural wild creatures such as gnolls or leprechauns do count toward this, but thieves that belong to a civilization such as kobolds do not.</p>
		  <p>Training wild-caught animals is always a plus.  Make sure to designate an animal training area and assign each wild-caught animal a trainer.  This will also gain experience for your trainers.  The merit you get from training animals is retained even if the animal dies or is released into the wild.</p>
		  <p>Having a good animal trainer will make your game much easier.  A good animal trainer will have a much better chance of recruiting passing animals at a Nature Shrine and will have an easier time influencing animal behavior at an Advanced Animal Training Area.</p>
		  <p>If you've messed up somewhere and have become despised by nature, you will lose the ability to tame or train new animals, so, redeeming yourself will be much harder.  However, you can raise your status greatly by offering valuable items to the wild animals.  This can be done in two ways: either allow a wild animal to steal one of your valubles, or send a gnome into the wild while they are wearing valuable clothing or carrying valuable equipment.  Sending off a gnome wearing masterwork armor is a highly effective means of bringing your merit back up to high levels.</p>

<div id="hidden6" style="display:none;">
  <h1 align="center"><a name="DWARF" id="DWARF">Succubus Tips and Tricks</a></h1></p>
      <em><strong>1. Upgrading your fighters</strong></em></p>
          <p align="center"><em>Elite
succubi are not only excellent dodgers and strickers, they can also
bring powerful spells to the field. You can use the workshop profile
(shift + P) to select who gets the upgrade. They do not require an
enabled job.</em></p><ul><li>While
Gehenna fire provides good fire attacks, Torrid kiss is a free action
and will burn your enemies without interrupting melee attacks.</li><li>Berserk
rage is more effective if the fighter is miserable but still have
effect if the fighter is happy. It can be combined with Martial
Excitation.</li><li>Learning the secrets of lust provide area of effect
buffs and dimming interactions. At regular intervals, the courtesans
will blink, meaning that their combat abilities are multiplied. </li></ul><p align="center"><em>
            <strong>2. Clearing sieges</strong></em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>It
is important to clear sieges before late spring to allow your
civilization's caravan to visit you, otherwise you will not receive
migrants for a year. There is a few rituals that can help you :</em></p><ul><li><em></em>Sow
discord (6 souls) will cause infighting among the
invaders. This is the quickest way to get rid of a squad of enemies.</li><li>Lure invaders (1 soul) will break camps and call all the invaders into your traps.</li><li>Conjure
fire storm (temple of fire, 1 soul) have a decent chance to burn
enemies outside. It is especially good if your fighters are fireborn.</li></ul><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">3. Fire immunity</p><p style="text-align: center;">The
temple of fire provides fire - and cold - immunity. You can use that to
channel magma, work on glaciers, throw burning attacks safely or play
in the
forest fires.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If a succubus can be
fire immune, her clothes will not be. To avoid accidents, military
uniforms made of fire safe materiel can help you. Or you can assign an
empty uniform in 'replace clothing' mode, the succubi are much less
affected by the lack of clothing.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">Do not forget that you can still drown in magma.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">4. Evil biomes</p><p style="text-align: center;">On
the surface of evil biomes, you can pick black roses and bloodworms.
Wine made from those plants will have positive effect on your succubi.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If your civilization has settled on evil biomes, you will also be able to buy those plants from the carvans.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">5. Adventuring as a succubus</p><p style="text-align: center;">There
is plenty of caste choices as an adventurer. Half breed all have their
perks, and fireborn succubi can swim in magma. Use the gender selection
before starting your adventures to switch castes.</p><p style="text-align: center;">If
you look at the civilization's border before starting, you will likely
find forts with succubi soldiers to recruit inside. After completing a few
quest, the local lady will give you more tasks, allowing you to work for your
civilization instead of humans.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><br /></p>
