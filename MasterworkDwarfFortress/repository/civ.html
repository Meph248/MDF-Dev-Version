              <p>A unique feature of MDF are the multiple playable races. Not only sturdy and heavily drunk dwarves can be played, but also others. You can experience the game from the point of view of curious kobolds, evil warlocks and their undeads, demonic succubi, proud orcish warriors, human merchants and gnomish inventors. But what is the best race for you? What are the differences?</p>
              <p><strong>Dwarves - Best metalworkers, smiths and miners.</strong></p>
              <p>Dwarves have the most features. They are the closest to vanilla DF and masters smiths and metalworkers. They have an extensive guild system, pray to Armok in their temples and are able to directly buy from merchants or embassies. Their weapons pack the hardest punch, but they require alcohol. They are the only race that can work Adamantine. Among the high-end features are rune inscriptions for weapons and armor, 6 schools of magic, and constructs like golems, landmines and turrets. </p>
              <p>They are easy to learn and easy to play.</p>
              <p><strong>Humans - Best traders, sneak-peak into all races.</strong></p>
              <p>Humans allow a view into all races. They are easy to play and very neutral. Master traders and diplomats, they get trade caravans from all races, even the evil ones. You can build a merchant and a workshop of each other race, having a peak into their special materials, items and abilities. Humans are afraid of the dark however and dont like being underground, they mostly build large towns and castles on the surface. They have a rigid guild system with a dozen different guildhalls and need to have open roads for caravans, which bring the needed outside workers. </p>
              <p>They are easy to learn and easy to play.</p>
              <p><strong>Kobolds - Chaotic, fast-breeding with low life expectancy.</strong></p>
              <p>Kobolds are curious. And therefore die a lot. Only having shovels at their disposal to dig, they live mostly on the surface and in the soil layer, except when embarking on a cave. The build with leather and wood, re-using their tents dozens of times for different uses. Since they are carnivores, you will need meat to feed them, which requires lifestock, hunting and fishing. Kobolds steal tech from other races, which might make them targets for extra sieges. Quick to die, but very resistant to tantrums, with a life expectancy of only 15 years, kobolds breed fast and populate their camps quickly. They only trade with other kobolds though, making them a hard race to play.</p>
              <p>They are ok to learn and hard to play.</p>
              <p><strong>Orcs - Good fighters, cuts scalps from invaders.</strong></p>
              <p>Orcs are proud warriors and come in many different variations. Your camp setup will vary depending on your migrants, be it ranged-skilled snaga, mighty ologs, commanding uruks, raiding corsairs, crafty artisans or magical dreamwalkers. Larger than other races, they make combat seem easy. They specialize in both finely-made handcrafted tribal gear, as well as cheap makeshift mass production. Influenced with themes ranging from samurai to pirates, from mongols and atztecs, they make for good succession forts. Orcs often raid other civs and get sieged more often, which suits them just fine. Among the higher-tech are exploding sappers, do-it-yourself flamethrowers and 4 groups of mages, unlocked by scalps of their enemies.</p>
              <p>They are ok to learn and easy to play.</p>
              <p><strong>Gnomes - Tiny Steampunk Druids, friendly to wildlife.</strong></p>
              <p>Gnomes love both nature and machinery. The most advanced race in the mod, stock full of unique features. Druidism allows to train any creature in very specific way, down to getting information from wandering birds or making groups of wild animals joining you by themselves. On the other hand you can simply build your own clockwork animals or gadgets like rocket boots, brainjacks and automated armors. Most buildings run on mechanical power, so you will need windmills and waterwheels. You can also build fully automated factory assembly lines, replacing all your craftsmen. Amont the high-end tech are tesla-coils, seismographs, drilling rigs and time travel.</p>
              <p>They are hard to learn but easy to play once figured out.</p>
              <p><strong>Succubi - Dungeon-keeperesque demon race, charming invaders to stay.</strong></p>
              <p>Succubi are a female dominated civ of red demon ladies. In corsets and boots. I have your attention? Good. They are among the evil races, closely linked to demons. Summoning new pets from the underworld in exchange for the souls of your killed enemies is a basic feature. Different temples of sins and lust allow map-wide effects. Their speciality however is charming captured invaders to your side. You can enlargen your fort by turning your enemies into willing slaves.</p>
              <p>They are ok to learn and ok to play.</p>
              <p><strong>Warlocks - Necromancers and Sorcerers, friendly to undeads.</strong></p>
              <p>Warlocks are the most specialised race in the mod. They do not trade. They dont get migrants. They dont even siege other races, if not directly called. Warlocks start with a handful of mages, getting two hardcoded migrant waves and thats it. They dont breed. You have a set amount of civ members and have to build you evil dominion with that, converting prisoners into ghouls, animating corpses into zombies and constructing skeletons from bones. Skin your enemies to write magic tomes on their flesh, raid the countryside for human cattle and build your ebonblack tower to the skies. Bonus points for embarking on an existing necromancers tower.</p>
              <p>They are hard to learn and easy-hard to play, depending on how well you figure them out.</p></td>
