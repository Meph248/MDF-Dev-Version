Everything in this folder should go directly into (DF Folder)/Raw/Objects/ 
Even the bin folder. That goes into /Raw/Objects/ too. 

The program is pretty hands-off. You choose how many creatures you want to gen, and it gens them for you. Seems pretty simple to me. You know when it's done because it quits.

Entity_random may or may not include computer-controlled civ data. If it doesn't, that's fine. It just means that none of the creatures you genned were deemed civ-worthy. Sometimes that happens.

Sometimes your creatures MAY have odd descriptions. This is because a computer can only go so far towards describing a randomly-generated creature. If you don't like it, think about how much time it would take you to go through 1000 creatures, read their raws, and custom-add a description to each of them that fits. I think that for 30 seconds of genning tops, DFRandCreature is doing pretty good.

On occasion it MAY start popping out messages in the error logs, probably related to Toady's old "XFingers_RQ_ANON" code, where fingers were toes and toes were fingers. If this happens, let me know.

Careful with thousands of creatures in Adv mode, by the way. Visiting the random civs can be awesome fun, but DF doesn't scale the ingame creature count relative to the number of species. Instead, they add up. 10000 creatures means approximately 50 times as many creatures ingame as you'd normally see. Toady One has only made about 650 creatures total. This gens up to 1000 at a time.

NONE OF THE CREATURES HAVE SPECIAL SYNDROMES. Nothing (should) set you on fire or poison you to within an inch of your life. There are a few (muahaha) exceptions, but other than that...

Enjoy!
